 I chose JW Marriott  This was because The airport proximity was much needed. The property had four stars on TripAdvisor.  I stayed at the property Oct 6, 2019 to Oct 7, 2019  I was expecting a peaceful stay  My experience The room has a musty smell. The pickup was poor. I got two queen beds instead of king bed requested.  My conclusion is Do not recommend
