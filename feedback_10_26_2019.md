Excellent work so far. The code is pretty powerful even now. Because with just some minor modifications the _feelings_ about a hotel can be run against **multiple** templates
that maybe targeted for multiple travel sites or for multiple audience.

## Quick fix
Currently if your template has a field that can not be found in the _feelings_ file - the code crashes. It makes sense to make the assumption: that template fields must be present in the feeling files. *But* a more robust response to those situation would be to go silent on that line. So say in a template it says ```The <stuff> is bad.``` and in the feelings we do not find any ```#stuff#``` heading, then let us just ignore ```The <stuff> is bad.``` line and not generate an error. The only two fields that must be
present in the feelings* files are: `#property_name#` and `#dates#`.

### Next steps
1. Fix the Quick Fix
2. When we run we create text file with the output. Right now it is just showing on screen. Let's do the output file name per the convention: `review_property_name_templatefilename.txt`
3. Write an utility function that given a sentence with incorrect punctuation and capitalization returns a well formatted sentence. Do not reinvent the wheel, NLTK should be able to do that. Or we should be able to find a python code - that does it. Let us talk about this before you start.

At the end of the steps we should be able to use multiple feeling files with multiple templates and the sentences will all come out with right punctuations.

>>Then real NL - which direction to go?
