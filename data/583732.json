I would stay here again if I returned to Disneyland HK. Here's why: 1. Proximity and multiple day tickets: The free shuttle service makes it possible for my little son to nap in the afternoon, and return the park later in the evening. It also meant we could stay till the park closed at night, and not worry about the long lines on the MTR and going back to the hotel. The shuttles were fast, and moved us back quickly. 2. Little Disney-themed souvenirs: my son loved the bedroom slippers (with mickey logo) and spotting the mickey logo at various places in the hotel. The toiletries and bathroom mirror were Snow White and the dwarfs. Cool. 3. Breakfast with Mickey: at about S$50 per person, this was totally worth it. Guaranteed sightings of Mickey and gang, who ensure time spent with each child (and adult), and lots of photos. Stay till the end of the 1.5 hours - Mickey and gang came round again to say good bye to those who were still around, so my son had extra time with them. Oh, and the food is quite good too - big spread, decent quality. Beats standing in line in the hot sun to take a quick picture at the park itself (although we did that too). 4. Great service: staff there are \"cast members\", like in the park itself. They were always helpful, polite and friendly.

The overall stay and service was very good though we did have some issues with finding Vegetarian food and specifically Indian food which is not very prominent on the menu. Thankfully a chat with the chef (room service helped us with that) and and giving him some suggestions on vegetables he could use got us a \"Jeera Aloo\" to go with our Rice. We were happy that the staff took that extra step to make sure we got something we wanted (quite badly!!) By chance, we happened to see a newspaper article before our Hongkong trip that mentioned Indian Vegetarian food in the Tahitian Terrace (at the Disneyland Park) and that was really a fabulous find.

We can't help but leave this hotel with a feeling of feeling CHEATED. Really regretted booking this hotel. My advice, stay at Hollywood instead as it is much more value for money than this hotel.

It was a 15 minute walk around to get to it due to the pool upgrades going on. By the time we walked back to the luggage storage it defeated the purpose of having a shower. Very poorly planned. The Hotel and Park staff were friendly. No complaints there. In hindsight the $610 HKD for the breakfast for two with the characters was not worth it. Breakfast was nice but they only had 3 characters in the room. Dinner at the Crystal Lotus was yum. Great food and excellent service. Would I recommend it? Yes..

This was our first time at the resort and at Hong Kong Disneyland -- we had been to Disneyland in Anaheim jut a month before. I'll try to focus just on the hotel. We booked a Fanstasia Room and received Room 5000. The lobby is on the Third Floor and the Fifth Floor is one floor above (there is a superstition against fourth floors in Asia). The rooms are appointed well and clean. There is no Wi Fi except in the lobby but there is a LAN connection (for a fee). The first impression I received was in the bathroom. There is a bowl with disposable combs, toothbrushes, razors, shower caps, etc. This is very common in many hotels, but each of the supplied items were of such low quality that you wonder why they offer it in the first place. It's almost as if just to try to fit in as a four star or five star resort, they try to supply these items simply so an assessor can check the correct boxes. The shower was set up in an awkward manner -- there is no separate shower booth, you are just showering outside of the tub on the bathroom floor which happens to have a drain. Again, they installed a rain shower showerhead, even though the existing showerhead was just as fine -- I assume all of these improvements ultimately get reflected in the prices we pay. I guess it can be contradictory, but I wished they ditched the above amenities and opted for more practical ones -- such as a universal electricity converter. The only one available was for an electric razor in the bathroom. So we had our iPhones, iPads, laptops all charging in the bathroom taking turns. And free Wi Fi. This is turning into a pet peeve -- hotels really should not be charging for Wi Fi or any internet access. Ultimately, I am starting to develop a rule that for any Disney hotel, the rule should be to get the cheapest room possible. You won't be spending a lot of time there except in the evenings. The Disney store in the lobby had a great selection of products so you can avoid the lines at the park. The front desk was helpful in arranging for the Prestige Tour last minute (highly recommended) as well as transportation. English fluency was not as big an issue as I had feared, everyone spoke decent English. On top of that, if you tip (HK$ 20) to a bell captain or doorman, you will definitely get attention and get better service. It appears the staff is being tested by dealing with all the mainland visitors and they would prefer to help tourists from anywhere else. I ordered room service once -- a hamburger which was just average. One big blemish on the experience. There are two choices for breakfast -- a buffet at Enchanted Sea Restaurant with the characters walking around or a la carte at Walt's Cafe. Ultimately, your kid will win and you will end up at the former, It would take superior negotiation skills with your kid (or your kid's absence) to end up at the latter. As you would expect, you pay for the potential to have Mickey, Goofey, Pluto or Daisey come by your table for a photo and an autograph. You definitely do not pay for the quality of the food. The food was on par with what I imagine they feed the enlisted grunts in the local army barracks. Really blah. The pre-cooked scrambled eggs were a watery goop, the sausages were inedible as was the mueslix. The breads were not bad (the croissants were crap). They know you have no choice but to come (because of the characters) and they know the food does not need to impress (quite scary).", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cLove disneyland!\u201d", "Author": "Minnie1206", "ReviewID": "UR130753645", "Content": "We loved our stay at disneyland hotel.

Staying at the Hong Kong Disney was the start of a memorable holiday. From the time we arrived at night till the afternoon when we left, we never stopped feeling special. We had a room overlooking the gardens and it was very comfortable, we would start each day with breakfast down stairs where we would be greeted by a staff member who would show us to a table and produce hot tea or coffee, had to train them to fill the cup and not give us a cup with the tide out, they quickly learnt and it became a bit of a joke each morning, all went towards making a happy start to the day. The hotel is only a 15 minute walk down a very pleasant pathway to Disneyland or you can catch the free shuttle, most days we would walk down and then catch the bus back. The train station is only a couple of minutes further on and for HK$55 you can get a 24 hour ticket and go everywhere, we did this on two days, just hop on and off when we felt like it. On the other days we caught the train into town to go to the different tourist places, very clean trains and only about 10 minutes between trains. Given how far out from HK the hotel is they don\u2019t rip you off, a can of coke was the same price as down town and the food from the restaurant was excellent. We did make pigs of ourselves and to hell with the waist line by going down stairs to the smorgasbord, what a treat, ended up going back on our last night, yep, it took a bit to return to my normal trim, taught and terrific shape ;) Price, well if you are coming this far then you might as well enjoy it, its well away from all the smog and noise of downtown and more relaxed than what we saw at the motels in Kowloon & HK and very nice to come back to at the end of a long day. We are saving to come back to HK again and we will be staying here and getting a three day pass to Disneyland.

It was a fantastic decision! Yes, the rooms cost quite a bit more than the regular floors, but it was more than worth it: - nice free breakfast in the club lounge (much more relaxed than the madness in Enchanted garden, great selection of hot & cold food) - cookies and drinks, snacks all day for hungry kids, wine & beer for parents at 6pm (there is nowhere to buy snacks nearby, so this was a huge plus), fireworks viewing from the small balcony - bedtime story, THEN, Mickey or Minnie come to say goodnight in their PJ's - crafts/activities throughout the day - Princesses visit the lounge in the morning too - also great if you see the queues at the park for this! You could also check in/out upstairs, buy tickets and get concierge service at the lounge, which was very convenient as there were always lines at the lobby.

We had 2 Kingdom Club rooms and we had access to the club lounge. It's definitely worth the extra bucks, the choices for breakfast were delicious, plus we would go there for our snacks, drinks and free wifi access. They even offer a free 5 minute massage, and there were coloring activities to keep the kids busy. The only flaw was that the princesses weren't scheduled to visit on all the days we were there, which was the one of the reasons I chose to upgrade to the Kingdom club rooms. Oh well. The huge chandeliers are an awesome sight. The jazz band playing in the afternoons were good. The pianist was playing some Disney tunes. Of course we also had 2 days in the Disney Park, but it was rainy on all the days we were there so we had the chance to enjoy the hotel a bit more too.

Words really can't describe how beautiful this hotel is! Full of all the details that make Disney such a magical place. I loved looking at the artwork, finding hidden Mickeys, and taking in the old world charm of the place. My husband spent a great deal of time just hanging out in the lobby reading a book, listening to the pianist, and people watching (especially when the princesses were out for greetings). When we first arrived we were swooped upon by bell staff who took our luggage and delivered to our room when we were checked in. The check in process was straight forward and quick. The cast member was also able to activate our annual passes, which it said needed to be done at the park gates - it did take a little while to organise that. The room we were checked into was beautiful, and looked out over the garden to the sea (we had booked a garden view room), however the smell was horrific (I hadn't thought to book a non-smoking room). I called to request a room change and within 10 minutes we were being shown to our new room. It had the same beautiful details, and came with a balcony, but overlooking the carpark. Still, we were happy to have the balcony with fresh air. We ended up having a partial view of the fireworks which was obstructed by a tree. The rooms have a subtle Snow White theme, particularly evident in the well appointed bathrooms, complete with 7 dwarf themed toiletries. We visited Walt's cafe a few times, for breakfast and dinner. Most times we were happy with the service and food, but felt it was a bit expensive for what it was. The butter chicken was the best meal I'd had for a long time. We also had a character breakfast at the Enchanted Garden, which was disappointing. There was a good variety of yummy food, but only 4 characters, and a lot of tables for them to visit. We expected more for the money (and it wasn't just a Disney thing, we felt our character breakfast in Anaheim was much better value for money). The pool was closed for maintenance while we were there, and it was really too cold for swimming anyway. It looked lovely though, complete with waterslide. The indoor pool looked nice too, but is pretty small. We didn't get a chance to try out the spa or anything. The gardens were beautiful and immaculately kept. It was really nice just walking around checking them out and taking in the sea view. It was a 10-15 minute walk to Disneyland along a beautifully landscaped path with Disney music piped in. We only caught the shuttle a couple of times as we found it crowded and really unnecessary given the proximity of the hotel to the park. The only complaint I would have about the hotel was a funny scraping noise coming from above us on a couple of nights. I'm not sure what it was, and it wasn't loud, but enough to keep me (a very light sleeper) awake.

The breakfast buffet in the \"Enchanted Garden\" with photo opportunities with Disney characters was reasonable value with a wide choice of Chinese, Western, Japanese and Indian dishes. The room was what we expected based on the pictures in the hotel web site, The tub bath was nice, but the safety box would not have been big enough for a 17\" laptop. The very low-key DIsney theming in the hotel was actually something of a disappointment. I would have preferred to see more... Surprisingly the room service menu appeared to have better prices and a wider choice than the hotel restaurants, so we ended up using it for a late supper. The service was quicker than promised, and the food was tasty. The outdoor pools were closed for maintenance from January to March, but the indoor pool was fun enough being heated to 30 degrees Celcius. The life-guard on duty was very helpful, but the overall arrangements with the outside dressing rooms etc. were quite confusing.

Based on some other reviews I read here, I reserved a room in the Kingdom Club floor with a 2-day Disney pass package. Even though the room is more expensive, but it provides access to a lounge area that provides breakfast (reasonable selection), snacks and drinks, and evening cocktails and appetizers, which is well worth the extra price. We can see the firework from there at 8pm, followed by bedtime story time for the kids (Mandarin, Cantonese, and English). A Disney character (for us it's Mickey) will then come out to let you take pictures with him/ her. There are also \"princesses\" in the lobby from time to time for pictures. The one thing that our daughter loved is the \"my little princess\" dress up and photo shoot. We did it the morning of the day we are checking out, and our daughter wore the princess dress to the Disney park the rest of the day and had a blast. People actually waved and took picture of her! The hotel also gave her a birthday batch to wear so everyone was saying happy birthday to her as well. But parents, beware of the expensive photo trap. The dress up package include one 8x10 photo only, and they will try to lure you to purchase additional photos/ album/ keychain at a very high price. So you may want to do this step with your daughter tucked away so they don't beg you to buy them. The hotel has many other facilities (pool, gym etc) that we don't have time to try, as we are spending both days at the park. Our kids had a lot of fun (including our 2.5 year old son), a great family vacation for the kids though it's quite tiring for the parents.

In my opinion the club rooms are worth it - you make yourself known to someone in the lobby when you arrive and you are immediately taken up to the club lounge to check in with a cup of tea, coffee (very civilised!). The Kingdom Club room price included breakfast, snacks and drinks all day in the Club lounge and in the evening complimentary wine, beer and a delicious spread of little 'bitings' and mini desserts - a wonderful way to watch the 8pm fireworks which, if you are not in the park, can be seen from the club lounge balcony. Also Mickey and Minnie come into the lounge and say goodnight! Rooms were good - all in the Victoriana style (not usually my cup of tea but it's Disney and therefore it works!). Would advise getting the tickets for the park at the Club lounge on arrival - we got a very good deal and they gave us some fast pass tickets too. Also priority seats at the free shows - Lion King and The Golden Mickeys - both absolutely excellent.

Checking in took quite a while (about 1.5 hrs) as we have requested for an ajoining room. This is pretty disappointing especially after a tiring flight. However, the lobby was comfy to wait at and soothing as there was a pianist playing beautiful music to entertain waiting guests at the lobby. This probably made waiting more bearable. There is only a mini TV room at the lobby area with beautifully crafted kiddy seats to keep those active kids occupied while waiting. Room is beautiful, spacious and clean. We have booked two sea view rooms and the view is wonderful. Beds are comfy and large as compared to hotels in the main city area. Love the fact that the Disneyhotel is like a haven on its own, away from the hussle and bustle of the city. My 3 year old son loves the Disney Channel, the little bedroom slippers (kid-sized) as well as the bath robe (kid-sized too!!). Bathroom has a nice vintage feel and also feels spacious. Thoughtful enough to have a small stepping stool for kiddos who are too short to reach the wash basin. Toilertries are also Disney themed. Nice. There is also an activity room for kids where little girls can dress up as princess for a day. LIttle boys (like mine) are also entertained by its cute kitchen sets, colouring activities and friendly staff. The garden just outside the hotel is beautiful with colourful flowers and maze made out of neatly trimmed bushes. We had a great time at the garden. The Disneyland Hotel also provides free shuttle toand from Disneyland Park which I feel its excellent especially when you are travelling with kids and elderly. We can always go back to the hotel for a short rest before going back to the park again to enjoy the beautiful fireworks in Disneyland at night. Wonderful.

We stayed the first 2 nights in Disneyland HK hotel. My decision was based on other traveller\u2019s review saying that if you are going to stay in a hotel in Disneyland, it\u2019s better to choose the Disneyland Hotel over the Hollywood Hotel even if it\u2019s more expensive as the experience and the hotel is a lot better. If you are travelling with a big group of people, I suggest taking the taxi from the airport. There were 7 adults and 3 kids in our group, so we had to take 3 taxis. Each taxi ride costs ~HK$120 (A$15). It was convenient as we had a lot of luggage and cannot imagine using the MTR. We arrived around 12pm at the hotel. Since check in was still at 3pm, we checked in our luggage with the luggage counter initially. We were unfortunately not able to get a room early, and we had to wait for the first room to be ready at 1.30pm. To be fair, they at least made sure we had the 1st room of 3 rooms available as soon as possible so we can at least have a place to stay in/freshen up while we wait for the other rooms. However, that meant we still had to wait in the lobby for 1.5 hours before we can use the 1st room. The lobby itself was beautiful \u2013 as it was just days before Christmas, the decorations were very festive. However, there weren\u2019t enough chairs/sofas for guests to sit down while we all waited for rooms to be available. I think there were 3 sets of sofas, and that is nowhere near enough to accommodate people who are tired and waiting for hours to get their room. When we finally got to our rooms, they were beautiful \u2013 and just like in the photos. Each of our 3 garden rooms on the first floor had two queen sized comfortable beds, and the patio doors open up to the garden and the Mickey Maze. The small touches such as the Mickey Mouse slippers (which come in adult and children sizes), the intricate carvings of Disney characters in the bedroom and in the toilet added up to the Disney experience. Each room can accommodate 4 people, so at A$320/room/night, it\u2019s a good enough deal if there are 4 of you sharing in the costs. The convenience of the hotel cannot be overlooked as well, as there is a shuttle near the hotel lobby which takes you directly to the Disneyland Park. The shuttle comes by every 15min or so, and the actual ride takes about 5min. We had all our meals in the park, aside from breakfast. The hotel restaurants are pricier than the park restaurants/cafes, and so we made a conscious choice of eating our lunch and dinner at the park. A typical fastfood meal (we had most of our meals in Comet Cafe) cost between HK$50-80 (A$7-11). We had our first breakfast in the Enchanted Garden, and it is as lovely as all the reviews said. The cost for an adult is HK$283 (A$37) and for kids > 3 yrs old is HK$155 (A$20). The breakfast buffet selection is extensive \u2013 there is continental, American and asian selections. The Disney characters going around for photo opportunities around the tables was also priceless. I would recommend going to this breakfast at least once in your stay. Our second breakfast was in Walt\u2019s cafe \u2013 and this is cheaper than the Enchanted Garden. The cost for an adult is HK$198 (A$26) and for a child is HK$98 (A$14). The menu however is not extensive \u2013 and this cost only included a buffet continental breakfast plus 2 eggs and a meat (bacon/ham/sausage) of your choice. If you are not a big breakfast eater, this is not a bad choice. The prices of the merchandise in the hotel/park are surprisingly reasonable. We bought souvenir t-shirts (~HK200 each), magnets (HK40-70), dancing toys (HK200) and other items. The quality of all the items was good \u2013 and most of them are actually cheaper than the same items in the Philippines and in Australia. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if your budget will allow it. For a big group like ours, it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 we spent around HK$15,000 (A$2,000) for a 2 night stay in the hotel room, food cost for 2.5 days and 2 nights was around HK$7000 (A$920) for the food. Overall, we ended up spending around HK2,300 per person (A$290), for food and accommodation only, excluding the 2 day park entrance and miscellaneous expenses for souvenirs.

It is the best suite in Disneyland seconder than Walt Disney Suite which has 2 bedrooms. The staff in the hotel will accommodate whatever you want. Staff were so polite and helpful. The Crystal Lotus restaurant attached to the hotel served very good food though it is more expensive than having same dishes else where in Kowloon or Hong Kong island. They had Golden Fish in the Pond special dish that so amazed us. We had our christmas eve dinner in the Enchanted Garden. The cost was high but it worth spending the money as they have Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto comes to you in Christmas suits and take photos with your family. Being on the club floor, we had the privilege to enter the club lounge on the 7th floor and to take photos with Minnie on pyjamas on Christmas eve and with Mickey on Chritmas night.

Still, the whole experience left us with, if not a bad taste, certainly a bland feeling of stupidly having spent several thousand dollars (US) to experience unabashed mediocrity. I really shouldn't complain too much because the Tripadvisor reviewers with perspective clearly told me what to expect so we definitely expected much less from Hong Kong than from our previous FL or CA Disney visits. I that sense, I guess our expectations were met. The room we were asigned was a two bedroom suite on the Kingdom Club 7th floor, in terms of cleanliness, it was excellent. However, you can see the difficulty the developer of this property (Gov.?) must have had in finding talented workers to build this place, as evidenced by the really poor build quality of everything from the door hinges to the caulking on the bathroom fixtures (heard of a \"level\" anyone?). But anyhow, not terrible, just sorta sad when it comes to attention to details. At night they offered \"bedtime story\" telling at the Kingdom Club room, 8pm in Cantones, 8:20pm English, 8:40pm Mandarin. The staff member who told the story in English was ok, but I imagine she is much more fluent and entertaining in the other languages. The food was ok, nothing imaginative or remarkable, the people at the character breakfast were so pushy with the characters that I think it stressed Mickey out and he never came by our table, so after 90 minutes with two toddlers patiently waiting (not really), we finally left with the kids heads hung low because Mickey bailed on us or chose to skip out on our table, who knows. Oh well, they'll get over it. I would say our biggest disappointment was with the kids main playroom downstairs, IMHO, what a disservice this room is toward representing the values of the Disney brand. If I were paranoid, I would say it was almost like a outright effort was being made to sabotage the Disney brand by placing it in this sorry excuse for a playroom in a hotel that is supposedly focused on the kids experience. How important should the playroom be in a hotel that caters to kids? The nearly bare walls, almost no games for the kids, and a confused looking worker with a clipboard who added nothing except making sure you disinfect your hands before you enter this misguided interpretation of a playroom. My wife insisted we take pictures of this \"playroom\" and share them, because unlike other disappointment we endured (and mostly laughed off ) during our visit, this was something that could have been easily addessed if someone at the executive level at Disney Corporate takes a walk into this supposed playroom. Neither of us could not believe that anyone at the top of Disney would be able to rationalize this \"experience\" and allow the pervasive brand mismanagement to continue without doing something about it. I explain the whole experience, including nasty, angry looking \"cast\" members at the park, as a cultural chasm that originates with the fact that most employees here have no clue as to what it means to visit Disney as guests...the magic is an intangible, elusive concept to the natives here, and I believe it will take intensive training and retraining and re re retraining before a culture of excelence can be created at this property as well as the park.

I've stayed at the Hollywood Hotel previously when on a tour. It seems to be full of tourist groups and was crowded. In a more recent trip, my family of 4 stayed at Disneyland Hotel. It seems a lot more quieter and peaceful. Facility wise, both seemed about the same. They had free wireless in the lobby. Internet access in the room was available but only at a hefty fee. The two twin beds in the room were comfortable and big enough for my family of four. Transportation at Disneyland was well covered. There is a free shuttle that ran regularly, going in a circuit to cover both hotels and the main transit station (where DIsneyland entrance is, and the Disneyland MTR train station). The Disneyland MTR line operates only one stop and connects to the rest of the MTR lines from there. One would probably have to cater 15-30 min to get from the hotel lobby to the connecting MTR lines. We travelled all over Hong Kong on the MTR. Having the Octopus cards (for buses, MTRs, tram at The Peak) made travelling a breeze. One mistake I made was not getting the Octopus cards refunded before I crossed through immigration to depart. There isn't an outlet after immigration to do so! Sigh. The Disney character breakfast at the hotel is a must! Book with the front desk. The stars of Disney, namely Mickey, Goofy, Pluto, and Daisy went around each table. Pluto was particularly playful and interactive. It was a most fun event for my family! I wish though that they had a more substantive shopping and dining belt across the hotels. Much like what is seen at their Orlando locale. Disneyland is pretty much on its own on Lantau Island.

Perhaps since I do this for a living I might be a bit jaded, but I found my stay at the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel to be very nice, with friendly and helpful staff and generally good amenities. I would stay here again (and probably will be coming back sooner than I think!). The Service: I found the service at the front desk to be efficient and friendly, and did not have any wait at check-in (we arrived around 8 p.m. at night). On weekends, things definitely picked up in terms of the number of people in the hotel lobby, so there was a queue waiting to be checked in. We stayed in the Kingdom Club rooms, which was great. With Kingdom Club you get the breakfast buffet and drinks/desserts in the afternoon/early evening just before the fireworks go off. This was a much-appreciated amenity - the chance to check email (via free wifi) while having a glass of wine in the evening. Service in the Kingdom Club was well-done, and Yvonne in particular was very helpful - she located my missing scarf that I had left in Walt's Cafe the day before. The Room: Really liked the room, and that's important since I was there for 10 days! Room had two double beds, as well as a table/desk and two chairs. The bathroom was great - loved the rainfall shower head and the fact that you got a fair amount of toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, shaving kit, sewing kit, toothbrush/toothpaste...). Since I had forgotten to pack my razor, that shaving kit came in handy. The rooms come with a hair dryer, and if you need a converter plug, you can get one from the front desk. There is a coffee/tea pot in the room as well as a stocked small fridge (stocked with soda/candy). If you need your fix of strong coffee, I suggest you bring your own Starbucks Via, because they only have the Nescafe instant coffee here (ugh!). Internet Access: As has been noted by other reviewers, you have to pay for in-room internet access (via cable connection), otherwise you can pick up the free wifi in the lobby and Kingdom Club. This is one area where things could be improved - because of this, people sit around the lobby, checking email on their laptops/IPhones. In fact, it was problematic because there was limited to no lobby seating at times because of excess wifi users :-)! Short of getting in-room free wifi, I would recommend setting aside some area as a 'wifi lounge' where folks can do their business, print out boarding passes, etc. The Food: We ate at two places in the Disneyland Hotel - Walt's Cafe and the Crystal Lotus. The Crystal Lotus is Chinese cuisine, and was excellent in quality. We got the full dinner option, which ended up being way too much food. Ate several times at Walt's Cafe, which is a mix of asian and western cuisines. Generally liked all the food I had at Walt's in terms of quality. Service here was mixed - sometimes it was great (Anny in particular was a fantastic server and had real Disney pixie dust), other times it was disjointed. You would ask for a beer, and then...you would end up waiting...make another request...you get the picture. Did not know if this was a cultural thing (serving the beverage with the food) or not.

Both our wife and I was sitting there since we want to save HKD22 for a plain water, we opt just to seat there. Nobody offered us any drink (either they think we are too cheap to pay or it's just pure ignorance) Staffs at the check-in counter is not as friendly as the one you can find in other 5 star hotels. For those of you who wants better room, better rate, better food, I would suggest staying at Citygate. 10 minutes from Disneyland with HKD100 taxy fare to Disneyland, I would think that you better spend HKD100 on taxy rather than stuck in the resort and having to pay much more for dinners and lunches. Room interior: I find it just an OK room without any special feature other than part where disney characters can be found inside the room (etc on the carpet) Lobby Area: Love it....such big nice christmas tree. A couple of notes: - Free internet only when you go to the lobby area. Internet in your room means extra money. - All bed are twin bed (2 bed).

Currently there is a promotion for breakfast at the Enchanted Garden if you make your reservations online via their website. We headed to Disneyland on Day 1 of our HK trip and arrived at the hotel around 1.30 PM. Our bags were swiftly taken away by the porters at the foyer, and after completing the check-in process, was told to come back at 3PM to collect the room key. There was a lovely Xmas tree and a large gingerbread house in the lobby, it smelt so nice! There are some cafes at the lobby where you can sit to have a cuppa or you could eat lunch at the Chinese restaurant while waiting for your room to be ready. (Tip for Muslim travellers: either eat or pack Popeyes from the airport to bring to the hotel) We were quite tired so we rested the lobby for a bit, finishing our lunch. Next to the reception, there is a small TV room for the little ones to watch Disney Junior. A hidden gem is the Prince Eric room on Level 1 where your kids can do some crafts, or play with the toys...it was empty when we went there, even though there was so many kids running around in the lobby. It is free to enter the room (just show your room card) and they have scheduled craft sessions as well for a small fee. My girl was given a small set of colour pencils after she completed her colouring. There are also some small wooden toys (stackers, blocks, bead chasers) for the younger ones. The minders in the room will play with/look after your kids but an adult has to be present but you can always doze off on the comfy couches there while your kids play :) Next to the Prince Eric room is the Princess Makeover room. It is open on weekends and for a tidy sum, you can get your girl all Princessed-out and have their photo taken. I was there on a weekday, so it was closed but I was told you could approach Kingdom Gifts (the gift store at level 3) to make an appointment. There is a shuttle bus that takes you to the park, comes every 10-15 minutes. The bus also stops by Hollywood hotel, so you can drop off there to take a look. The Disney Princesses make an appearance at the hotel lobby as well, I really have to take my hats off to them because Snow White and Aurora stayed in character, took the time to make small talk with the kids, one girl even brought an autograph book that they gamely signed in. Check for the timings with the concierge desk. The room - We got the Fantasia room, which was a turret room with a view of the lawn and the sea. The room was large, beautiful, clean and comfortable. There was a jacuzzi in the bathroom, and a rain shower, very nice after a day out at the park. The room came with a king bed, and I requested for a baby cot but was so tired at the end of the day that all 4 of us slept on the bed together. The service - prompt, polite, helpful. I asked for late check out and they extended it to 12 nn (from 11am, but hey). Since we had a two day pass, after checking out, they stored our bags and we hit the park. When we left Disneyland to go into the city for the rest of our holiday, the staff helped us with the cab and bags and waved us off! So nice :) If I could do this all over again, I would have opted for a cheaper room but stayed 2 nights instead so that we would not have to rush off after the second day at the park. Yes, a Disneyland experience does not come cheap, but you get really caught up in the moment and things like credit card bills are forgotten :D Some minor grouses was they had a lot of things for girls, but not so much for boys. Also, their tshirt sizes are for 2 yrs and above?

Book a Kingdom Club Room: More relaxed breakfast. Great for watching the fireworks each night (lounge balcony). The Princesses pass through the lounge first each day with many less children they each got to spend more time with them. The complimentary appertifs each evening were enough to fill us. The story time and goodnight from Mickey or Minnie were eagerly anticipated by our child. 2. Buy a Platinum Annual Pass for at least one of you: The discounts on food and accommodation means it will more than pay for itself. If you're celebrating a child's birthday the pass provides extra benefits including a free cake and dinner in the buffet restaurant (Enchanted Garden). Provides fast passes for up to 3 people for the selected rides. We did all of the above during our 3 night stay and we experienced some great service, especially from the Kingdom Lounge staff. Double beds are generally too small for us (I'm 6'2\") however we generally managed to sleep ok. The room amenities were great, right down to the differing robe sizes for each of us. I used both pools and they were great. The Highlight for us was being made Grand Marshals of the daily parade!! :-) This was our 2nd stay here and the added expense of the Kingdom Club and Platinum Pass made the hotel stay and going to the park much more enjoyable.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cAmazing for Kids but Mentally Prepare Yourself for the Crowds and All the Extra $$$ You'll Be Shelling Out\u201d", "Author": "LittleEinNY", "ReviewID": "UR121104832", "Content": "We are a HK-based family (2 adults, one toddler) and decided to stay at the Disneyland Hotel on a Saturday night for a mini weekend getaway. We stayed in a Fantasia Room. Pros: - Amazing for children. The room has child-size robes and slippers and a little step stool that can be used in the bathroom or by the window. At the check-in, there is a small area with stools and a TV playing cartoons for the kids. Staff are all very friendly and attentive to children. - Great bathtub with jacuzzi jets. - You can't beat this location if you are going to Disneyland. - The Chinese restaruant (Crystal Lotus) is quite good but expensive for what it is. - The Theme Breakfast at the Garden Terrace Restaurant is a must-do. It's pretty average breakfast buffet but the Disney characters show up during the breakfast to greet the diners. This was definitely worth the ~300HKD per head because the characters were there for a full hour and gave everyone plenty of time to take pictures and \"chat\" with the kids. Each character walked around with a helper who was very eager to help snap family photos. Cons: - Service is sub par. We had booked (and confirmed) a king size room and when we checked in (at the check-in time of 3PM nonetheless!) we were told that they only had rooms with 2 double beds or rooms with one double bed and a sofa bed available. Otherwise, we could pay an additional 500HKD to upgrade to the Fantasia Room with a king bed. I mean, seriously?! Not wanting to start the weekend on a sour note, we just ended up sucking up the 500HKD and upgrading. I would have given this hotel a 4-rating if we had not had this experience at check-in. - Service is sub par. I had called in advance to request a crib and we had to ask 2 times before it was actually delivered. - Service is sub par. When we checked in to our room, we were so pleased to find that the hotel had treated us to complimentary champagne, cookies and flowers....only to find that the note card was adressed to some other guests. We drank the champagne, ate the cookies and took the flowers anyway. - The room is not small but I would categorize it as being only moderately sized. - Only one sink in the bathroom. - No booze in the minibar. - The entire decor of the hotel is kitchy. - Crowds. Crowds. Crowds. Everywhere. - The room rate is expensive. Tips: - I think the rooms facing the garden/water are nicer but you can't see the fireworks from this side of the hotel. However, there is a balcony (on the 5th or 6th floor) where you can go to see the fireworks. - Definitely book the Theme Breakfast in advance. They do 2 seatings, one at 730AM, the other at 9AM. We did the 730AM seating on a Sunday since the 9AM was fully booked (and I called 5 days in advance). The 730AM seating didn't seem to be full when we went and the Disney characters were there from 8AM-9AM. - Book your room early.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellence + Relax\u201d", "Author": "D_R_ABishop", "ReviewID": "UR120977389", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights in Seaview Balcony room.

This was my 10th Disney hotel over all Disney parks around the world (California, Florida, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong) and this is by far the best Disney hotel I have ever slept in. While externally the Hotel is similar to the Grand Floridian in Orlando and the Paris Disneyland Hotel - inside it is certainly a little darker and less pink, picky dusty and more in line with the new Tokyo Disneyland Hotel. Disney plays very successfully with Hong Kong's former British heritage what is reflected in the decoration and look'n'feel of the property. A true highlight is obviously the sea view form the lobby and the rooms: a Disney unique in Hong Kong. We did reserve a Kingdom Club floor room - so check-in was held in the club lounge. Traditional Disney check-in: hotel information, character breakfast, parks and parades: everything you need to know. The Kingdom Club lounge is a nice little salon that features drinks and snacks and hot petits fours in the afternoon with some wine. You can see the park's fireworks from a little balcony with the music in synch - yet we did not test this so I cannot comment if its really worth it. There is free wifi inside the lounge (only). Room was a standard Kingdom Club room with sea view. It was very big and certainly the most luxurious I have seen in any Disney hotel. Decoration is again influenced from colonial chic, mixed with Disney and Victorian charms giving the room an almost historic appeal. Everything about this room is above Disney average: from the little make-up table to the Chinese porcelain decoration on the walls. It keeps getting better in the bathroom: big walk-in shower, tub and all pink marble. The parks and railway station are located withing 10min walking distance - alternatively there is a shuttle service. We did not test any of the hotel's leisure facilities like the spa, pools or the gardens. I cannot repeat myself enough praising this hotel - it is a truly remarkable property and certainly Disney at it's best : I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel.

I also ask the hotel if they can reserve a cake for my daughter's birthday. And they said yes.

The park is just a 10 min walk or you can ride the shuttle bus. As like all Disneyland parks its just a world of fun and fantasy for children. I recommend all of it, but the fireworks at 730 pm is worth either staying around for or coming back to the park to see. The Lion King show was also brilliant. Very Talented singers and dancers. So if your looking for a short break with your kids, then this is the place to go. You will be tired by the end of day 1 but the plus is so will your children or child, so maybe a good nights sleep for all..... Now why did that not happen to me, think mine was so excited from seeing all the Disney characters he could not sleep", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent kids experience\u201d", "Author": "DanishexpatinKL", "ReviewID": "UR119611544", "Content": "Two aduls and two girls 4 and 5 with a mission to visit the Disney princesses.

A great choice - real value for money. The staff were very service- and children minded. Amazing how parents of young kids can relax and enjoy themselves when the kids are 100% welcome. As tacky as the Disney concept could seem it was impressing how good the Disney caracthers were at connecting to each child and making them feel special. The rooms were pure luxery - not a finger to put on anything. The dinner at the Enchanted Garden was a hit - especially Goofy and Pluto were real good with our girls. Great food, but a bit wasted since the intertainment was in focus. Pricy... We had great weather - according to recommendations Oct/Nov and Mar/Apr are the best months.

But, for the simple fact that they continually put a smile on my child's face, I give them the top score. This Victorian themed hotel is Disney kitsch at its best. A grandiose foyer with a faux antique elevator greets you, but only after your senses are assaulted by guests who choose to smoke at the driveway while chatting in their heavily accented mandarin. Make no mistake, this Disneyland is in China. And Disney sure knows how to appeal to the mainland Nuevo Riche. (While this is hearsay, since I have not personally experienced it, I have it on good authority that the adjacent Hollywood hotel is even worse!) Here's why they get 5 stars. Service. Every where you go, the smiles are genuinely contagious. This is after all the happiest place on earth (or at least in China). Staff appear genuinely warm and helpful, and the ratio of staff to guests is optimal for when we visited in mid-October. Staff are also empowered to please; most carry stickers or little items to please the little guests and almost everyone speaks (or tries their best) 3 languages - Cantonese, Mandarin and English. For me, the ultimate test came when my daughter left her comfort blanket in the room. The hotel immediately arranged to have it shipped back to us. Also, for the little guests, everything is kid sized. Miniature bathrobes, slippers, a thoughtful stool in our room all came in very handy. All amenities are Disney themed and playing find the hidden Mickey is an endless source of joy for any child. The prince Eric playroom with activities from 9am to 10pm will also keep young guests entertained when they're not at the theme park. Breakfast at the enchanted garden is also a very special treat. Diners get visited by the main Disney characters and every table has the opportunity to take pictures with the stars. This will save you valuable queuing time when in the theme park. This meal sure beats the various options available. A very limited and mediocre breakfast at the Chinese restaurant will set you back $170 per adult and room service will cost upwards of $210. The premium which the enchanted garden commands at $258 per adult is in my opinion worth it... Both for the entertainment and the choice of food. Now where could they have done a little better? I think for one, dining choices at the hotel are quite poor. Walt's cafe is expected to open by end-2011 and that should add another choice to an otherwise limited selection of dining locations and menu choices. I can't imagine staying beyond 3-4 days. Especially since eating out really isn't an option. There also isn't a supermarket within the vicinity, so all incidentals need to have been brought along. Also, this means that suddenly the mini-bar seems like a very viable option... Thankfully it's not overpriced, but a vending machine surely would have been appreciated. We also noticed that the towels in the room were frayed and while they advertised that the double rooms would sleep four, I suspect they meant dwarfs. 2 and a half large asians struggled to sleep comfortably. But really, I'm nitpicking. I would come back to stay here - if for nothing else, to see that wide grin on my daughters face when Pluto rubbed noses with her.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel but pricey restaurants\u201d", "Author": "EH78", "ReviewID": "UR119052773", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights & had a 2 day pass to Disneyland.

As we were staying at the hotel we got access to buy the 2 day stay pass which was worth the extra money. This pass allowed us to pace ourselves at the park. We booked a garden view room which had two double beds and plenty of room to move. Everyone got a pair of slip on slippers which was a nice touch. As my sons birthday was that month he got this cute cake made of towels. It was very cute! The foyer was beautiful. Try and go around xmas time as they really make the place look beautiful. Beautiful tree dominated the foyer. Kids go a picture with Santa, Check in was very smooth. We spent most of the day at the park and came back in the afternoon for a nap. Then went back for the fireworks and the magical moment of snowflakes flowing down. This was very special. The bus service too and from the hotel and park was well organised and did not have to wait long. Beds and room very comfortable. We did the characters breakfast - not to be missed! A highlight for the kids and the food quality and variety was very good. The food at disneyland itself was expensive and not great! But food at the hotel was excellent. We took a taxi from the Salisbury YMCA to the Disney Hotel and while I can't remember the price I thought it was ok. Better than lugging suitcases around on the train. If you want to really make the experience extra special for the kids its worth it to stay. We tried to book an extra two nights (due to holiday changes) but it was booked out over the week-end. So another good tip is try to go and stay midweek as we never felt the crowds either at the hotel or the park. In terms of place to stay in Hong kong, while I know it is not central it does give you 2 double beds in one room with plenty of space to sit and for your suitcases it could be a choice to stay at even after your disney experience.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cKid Heaven!\u201d", "Author": "pageantqueen", "ReviewID": "UR115031152", "Content": "(written by 12 year old Ari) Firstly, when we booked the hotel room, they were all full for weeks but luckily, when my dad was on the phone to them, someone canceled right there so we got a room! We came to this hotel expecting 5-star quality and we did. When we booked for a kingdom club room, there was a mix-up with the days of our stay but they fixed it in no time. Right after we checked in, we went straight up to the kingdom club. There are snacks throughout the day and the staff were very friendly. The room was amazing with comfortable beds and you can even watch Disney channel in the bath! We arrived in the afternoon so we went to the pool. As kids, we loved the water slide! Here are some water slide tips for parents to give to their kids: Slide backwards on your knees otherwise you won't go fast at all; you'll just get stuck. Also, if you want to make a train, there is a sensor at the top of the slide to make the light go red; indicating you can't slide. Squash down and miss the sensor and wait in the middle of the slide. Since the light will be green, just go and you can make a train! After swimming, we had a delicious lunch and went to relax in the room. At night time, we went to the Disneyland park. We started walking towards a surfing mickey mouse. Suddenly, there was a change in the music and the water went colourful. It was amazing! Then we watched the beautiful fireworks and got Disney Fever! We went home and had room service dinner and eventually went to sleep. The next day, we woke up and had our complimentary Kingdom Club breakfast (I had a mickey mouse waffle with strawberries and sprinkles). We really wanted to swim so we did for half an hour. Then, we went to Disneyland! We had our fastpasses so we started off using it for Buzz Lightyear which was our favourite ride! We then waited in line for the Orbitron. It was very fun, but a short ride. After that, we went and played in the water ufo zone. We were so hungry so we went and had fried chicken at starliner diner. The other things were too full so we set off to adventure land and had a short wait for the Jungle River Cruise, which was also incredible. On our way to Fantasy Land, we caught the 'Flights of Fantasy' parade and watched some of it, but it was just too hot so we left in the middle of it, which was a good idea because the ride lines were very short. We needed aircon so we went to the 4D show which was amazing and so fun! I really wanted to see the Lion King so we went with our fastpasses and were whisked into the show in the front seats. When we went past the queue, we heard a few moans and groans! It was so worth getting to the front because we got lots of high fives from the actors. I really wanted to do more rides in fantasy land, but it was just to hot so we went shopping and bought T-shirts. We returned to the hotel and although we couldn't get to our room, we could still go to the Kingdom Club (we went on a sugar rush because of all the candy) and go swimming. We didn't want to leave so we hid behind the concierge but eventually we had to!

The room was big, clean, well maintained and had lotsa small personal Disney touches that we were blown away by ! We had reserved for dinner with the characters on our 3rd night and my wife had a ball of a time taking pics with all her favourite characters !! Characters keep popping up in the hotel in the mornings for a fotoshoot. The hotel has buses every 5-10 minutes to Disneyland and also the metro station which connects you to the rest of Hong Kong. We ended up going to Ngong Ping, HK City day and night tour, Ocean Park, DisneyLand, Madamme Tuessads and the Tram while we were there.

The room was large and spacious, and the two queen-sized beds were really very comfortable. As expected, a lot of things in the room were Disney-themed, including the toiletries, but the room itself isn't very Disney overload. A big advantage of the hotel is its proximity to the park. As guests we were guaranteed tickets to the park, but admission is not included in the room. Food in the hotel is overpriced. Breakfast at the Sorcerer's Lounge in the lobby was overpriced and very sad; there was almost no hot food and not filling. Good for kids maybe, but we were sorely disappointed. We had wanted the meet-and-greet breakfast at Enchanted Garden, but it was fully booked. We looked in at the buffet dinner at Enchanted Garden, but we were unwilling to pay HKD488 per adult for 'international buffet'. It's better to eat at the Hollywood Hotel. They have more eateries and are generally cheaper than Disneyland Hotel. We liked the Hollywood and Dine \"fast food\" place because it was less posh and pricey (average meal is under HKD100). We had dinner at the Indian buffet in Hollywood and Dine, which was much more reasonably-priced at HKD160/head. The shop in the lobby is quite well-stocked and very good for last-minute shopping. You can also send anything you buy from the park back to the hotel for no additional charge, which is very useful if you're traveling light.

Staff is very frienldly and eager to help, though everything is already perfectly organized and managed.

Can go on describing the good sides, like swimming pool, a lot of kids programms etc. We loved it and for sure will return next year. There were only three things that minorly upset us and I assume the management needs to take care of such first was the noise from the ventillation shaft, You can manage the AC and having kids sleeping with us we turned it of for the nights. The ventillation worked constantly and You can not manage it. The noise was quite loud and unpleasant. As I understood we had the end of the corridor suite and only such rooms had this problem. We complained, they said they solved, but the noise remained same second was the smell from the toilet in the master bathroom. The suite has two bathrooms (which is great), we also had another toilet in the connected room, but only toilet in the main bathroom smelt. We complained - nothing was done. We did not bother. But it is not correct Third is very important and my wife and nanny were very much upset. There are a lot of different insects in Asia. In this hotel we did not see a single fly, cockroach or mosquito which was great. But there were little black kind of flies - very tiny, in the park, at the swimming pool. You lie down at the swimming pool and from nowhere 20 or 30 such flies appear and bite. You either have to stay in the swimming pool or cover with towels and sweat.

We were staying in Hong Kong for a week and decided to finish our stay at Disneyland, since it is 15 minutes from the Airport and would be a nice finish to our Asia trip. The hotel is really understaffed. The queue to check-in is horrendous and for some reason it takes a long time for each guest to check-in. We waited for 30 minutes in line before we were helped. They offered us fast-pass tickets in lieu of our inconvenience. I had reserved a bayview room with balcony, however after check-in the room was the regular garden view, no balcony room. I called down to the desk and I was told \"they are too busy and will have to call me back\". So I decided to go down and wait again. My son was still in the room and they finally called back, just to tell us to come down (I was already waiting in the dreaded queue again). They put me in the room I had reserved however gave me the rate of the less expensive room - which was nice. The restaurant service was very hit and miss, everyone seemed to be really busy - they are just understaffed in most capacities. It was amusing to me to find cigarettes and alcohol in the Disney store shop there in the hotel, however there really are no other stores or convenience markets anywhere nearby. No complaints about that. The pool is nice however don't expect to have a quiet relaxing day at the pool, its full of kids - which is expected for a family resort. The gym was OK - wifi was free in the lobby, so everyone was hanging out there. The room was average size, but clean, the bathroom was tight for sure. The shuttle bus was dependable and on-time going to-from the park. The prices were a bit steep for food/drinks, however that seems to be the norm in Hong Kong/China, seems inflation is a bit out of control. I would not go back - i would prefer to stay in Kownloon or Hong Kong and just take the MTR in.

I arrived with my family around 11am to check in before continuing to the park (I only stayed one night). There were only two front desk staff doing the check-ins, and I had to wait at least 30 minutes in the line, and i was like the 3rd in the 10 guests queue. When it was my turn to be served, no apologies at all. I had to actually complained to her, but the staff just half heartedly listened to my complaint. The only minor consolation was it's my son's birthday. They had a screen near the entrance, announcing who's birthday were on that day. My kiddy was kinda proud that his name came up on the screen, and there was a little present and card presented in the room for him. I only went in to the room like 10 pm as spent the whole day at the park, which was easily accessible by the free shuttle that comes quite often. The room was okay, standard amenities. There was a wet patch on the carpet near the entrance, but I didn't bother to complain to the front desk as all I wanted to do just sleep after the day out. Spent the morning having breakfast at the Enchanted Garden (?), again lots of people. Apparently they divided the brekkie into 2 allocated time (I was asked when checking in), the first was like 7am-9.30am, and then 9.30-11am (mine). The varities are plenty, ranging from asian menus to bacon and egg, kids menu (like mickey mouse waffles). Worth paying the money for the varieties and the staff always ensures that the trays were never empty. We also had the Disney characters walking around to take pictures with. I bought the 2daystay tickets, but didn't go back to the park the second day. So, if you're not staying for more than one night, don't buy it, not worth it as most likely it's gonna get wasted. if you want to stay longer than one night, stay because you wanted to go back to the park the next day, but if you want to travel around HK, not worth the trip as it's quite secluded from the rest of the town.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cProbably too long of a stay\u201d", "Author": "Dingmomma", "ReviewID": "UR104221062", "Content": "We checked in on a Sunday and stayed until Friday. We arrived around three o'clock in the afternoon and when we walked through the main doors, we were greeted by a large crowd of guests in the foyer. As I tried to get checked in, some other couple jumped the line and the cast member didn't even bat an eyelash as she started helping them. When I finally got some help, I asked about complimentary upgrades and the cast member scoffed at me and said that there was no such thing. (see the previous review) She did offer a discounted upgrade for a sea view room with a balcony, which we decided to take. She then handed my children stickers and dismissed me. (Hoorah for Disney hospitality) The room was clean and the little Disney touches were really cute. My 3 year old especially loved the complimentary Mickey room slippers. The double beds were comfortable and the Disney channel kept the kids entertained while my husband and I unpacked. Throughout our stay, cast members either ignored us or stopped to give the kids cards and stickers which makes it hard to critique on service since it was so inconsistent. Even the cast members at the gift shop were inconsistent. Some girl rolled her eyes as if we was bother her when we had questions about some of the products. On another day, a different cast member was so helpful we spent HKD$850 at one go. As for food, we ordered room service and it was nothing spectacular but the convenience was unbeatable. We tried breakfast at the Sorcerer's Lounge and that was a little disappointing. There was a congee, lotus leaf wrapped rice, shrimp dumpling, fried noodles and crab meat dumplings for the oriental spread. There was yogurt, cold cut platter, cheese, four kinds of cereal and a small selection of pastries. The selection was limited for what we paid and I had to flag down the server twice to get some coffee. The breakfast buffet at the Enchanted Garden was much better. There was a large variety of food and coffee was flowing. The kids met Mickey, Goofy, Pluto and Daisy. We also had the dinner buffet at Chef Mickeys and that was also really great. We didn't try any other restaurants at the hotel because we discovered that if we took a short train ride out to the city, the food was much better and cheaper. The hotel was actually quite secluded and to get to the park takes about 15 minutes on a bus. The bus schedule was quite nice though as we never had to wait for longer than 5 minutes for it to come by. The trek to the park gates was not appreciated as you can't rent strollers until you were in the park and our 3 year old had to walk the whole way since we had to carry our 18 month old. On our last day, we decided to participate in the activities of the hotel only to find out that Prince Eric's room was only available on weekends and peak days! Perhaps someone could have told us that in advance? No hotel information on line and no activity sheets unless you ask for it every morning. Sigh. At least we filled the time in with another trip into town, swimming and meeting the princesses in the foyer. If we were to return, it would be only for one night at most. Next time, we would probably stay at a hotel off property.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Subang Jaya, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cA magical experience together with the 5th Anniversary of Disneyland\u201d", "Author": "simonso", "ReviewID": "UR103840937", "Content": "The moment I reach Disneyland everything seemed so magical.

Access to the hotel was easy - we took the MTR to the park. The kids loved the Mickey Mouse themed train which took us the last stage from Sunny Bay. Getting to the hotel was easy using the nearby shuttle bus from the MTR station at the Park. Check-in was easy and the hotel plush and stylish - staff very helpful. Room was clean and well appointed. What disappointed us was the food choice. For our tastes only the \"Enchanted Garden\" fitted the bill but the bill caused us to rename it the \"Enchanted Rip-off\" as while the food choice was good you certainly paid for the Disney characters present at each meal. On the second day we opted for a late breakfast in the park and did the same for dinner. Dinner in the park - while not offering the buffet choice back at the hotel - for two adults and two children could be had for the price of one adult dinner back at the hotel! But as Disney know, the kids do love a meal where all of a sudden you can find Tigger at your table so you do have to grin and bear it occasionally as you wallet is gently freed of some cash. The other alternative is to stay off-site and commute to the park as the MTR link is c40 minutes from Hong Kong/Kowloon. However, for many people flying to the UK, us included, the convenience of being able to take a short taxi ride to the airport for your pre-midnight flight after a full day in the park makes an on-site hotel an attractive option.

Firstly, I could not find info about it in the bedroom and we only saw it when leaving the breakfast restaurant. It's basically a playroom with toys and no... we didn't see anyone chaperoning the children other than parents who just sitting around. When we entered, there was supposed to have been a guided activity where they were to make spiders. The guy who was in charge was late.. then he unethusiastically took out some pipe cleaners and started making his own spiders with them. Basically, the whole 'event' was so uninteresting and my daughter preferred the spiders I made for her. It wasn't well-led and many kids continued just doing their own things. Otherwise this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience! (It is rather painful on the pocket hence a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure too!)", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cnot as expected\u201d", "Author": "Vishalr", "ReviewID": "UR87760613", "Content": "i expected luxury and good serive, which was missing.

Everything in the hotel was well thought out to cater to Disney fans young and old (especially the young!). From the little TV corner next to check-in built specially for the little ones (TV a foot off the ground, chairs for little kids) to activity rooms for the kids to having Disney characters roaming the dining room during breakfast. For grown ups, there is a spa (which we didn't have time to try) and free internet connection in the rooms for when the kids hog the TV to watch the DIsney Channel (but bring your own laptop). Even the telelphone in the room comes with a video display that has a storytelling button to keep the kids occupied when the TV is off. All in, it was a pleasant stay for me as a parent with hyperactive kids. With all other families there seemingly in the same circumstance, I didn't have to worry at all about my kids being too loud, or running around too much or making too much of a mess during meals. To get to Disneyland park itself, there is a shuttle bus that leaves every 10 mins making a loop between the 2 Disneyland hotels and the theme park. Super convenient. The only downside is that it is a resort hotel with nothing else to do besides what's on offer at the hotel itself. Food is overpriced but that's what you get at the theme park so it's all part of the Disney experience. To wander further from the hotel, take the shuttle bus to the Public Transport Interchange (next to Dsineyland Park) and then catch an MTR to Tung Chung Station (1 stop away). Ngong Ping Village is there and there's a great 6km cable car ride that gives you great views from up high.

It is a rebuilt Victorian mansion-like hotel, but they did an excellent job and they used good quality materials.

Classical Disney tunes in all the hallways... Just go along and take it all with a huge (magical) smile. The rooms are large enough to accomodate a family of four. We had a standard room with two double beds. Beds a bit on the hard side, but nice pillows. Bathroom with lots of marble, fluffy towels, Snow White themed mirror and bathroom supplies, good shower (although in the bathtub). The pool area is nice but small. Kids liked the water slide although not really spectacular. Small playground next to the pool also nice. We also went to the kids play room (no extra charge, but you have to stay with them). Quite basic for a kids club: colouring, some toys, wooden play store... We came in twice but there was nothing 'organised' those times. Kids were not allowed in the 'haunted halloween area' that was covering part of the room... Staff was friendly, but with all parents there they seemed a bit bored. Next door you could do a make-over princess session (extra charge), which looked nice (but daughter (almost 8) thought she was too old for that anyway... Staff (restaurants, reception, door) was all very friendly and helpful. We had the dinner buffet with the Disney figures, which was great. Our toddler loved it! He would chase them and hug them (and they let him). Of course there is a photographer tagging along, offering adorable pictures and key chains for 'adorable' prices. But they are not pushy if you don't want to buy it, and you can take your own photos. The buffet was varied enough en tasty (nice desserts as well!). Kids buffet was lower, so they could help themselves. In the morning we had the breakfast buffet offered in the lobby/lounge area (without the Disney figures).

We had a Kingdom Suite room, which was not cheap however was sensational. The room itself was huge and split into a bedroom and lounge area, allowing my youngest to get an early night whilst the rest of us stayed up and watched a movie. The Kingdom club facilities were brilliant, with a surprisingly good breakfast buffet and snacks and drinks all day. Check in/out was a breeze as it is done in the club and not the main reception which did look very crowded. The hotels best asset by far was the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and my toddler could barely go 2 minutes without a staff member doting on her and giving her stickers. Even the gardeners and maintenance guys would stop and say hello. She LOVED the attention. (note the same can be said for the Disney park staff - also great) At night the Kingdom club staff read the kids stories and mickey would come to say goodnight in his PJs while we relaxed with complimentary drinks. We had a 2 day park pass and found our biggest challenge was that we didn't have enough time to fully take advantage of all the hotel had to offer. If I were to go again I would stay a 3rd day just to let the kids swim, do the activities, princess dressups etc. At the park there are big queues for photos with the characters, so we did the Enchanted Garden dinner buffet with the characters. This is also brilliant. Again it's not cheap but I have paid a lot more in other cities for less. The food selection and quality is great, more importantly the characters run around and play with the kids, keeping them enthralled and allowing the whole family a wonderful meal. A couple of tips - (1) Buy a park season pass for one of your party, it saves money on both the room rates and food. Even though it's pretty unlikely we'll use it again it saved us a fortune. (2) ignore the hotel shuttle bus to the park. It's a battle to get on and the park is 700m from the hotel door. It's a beautifully landscaped walk with fountains and way nicer than the bus option.

On both trips we stayed for more than two days. Tips when you stay at this hotel/resort: 1. When we stayed here way back in October 2009, it's less busier. There are more guests during the months of June than October. We have to line up for more than 30 minutes before we were entertained. We were one of those who have to leave our luggage at the counter and come back after 3pm (this is the official time of check-in). We came back after eating lunch at the Corner Cafe on Main street and returned at 4 pm and checked in and rested for nearly the whole afternoon. Even rides and attractions are busier. So tip #1 stay during the months of October instead of the summer months. And if it's your first time in HK do not just stay overnight...there are a lot of things to do and to see so, take your time to experience fun and relaxation whther inside the park or within the hotel premises and if you are the type that gets bored easily, stay for another two days at a downtown hotel or the other Disneyland hotel. It's worth being a child again...like myself. 2. There are two restaurants that offers buffet breakfast (one at Chef Mickey's and the other at the Enchanted Garden- located at the Disneyland hotel NOT at the Hollywood hotel) and if you were to compare their breakfast rates, they are more expensive compared to burgers, pasta and the like at the park. We paid HK$135 per person at Chef Mickey's and HK$207 per person at the Enchanted Garden. Enchanted Garden has more menu/food selection than Chef Mickey's and if you would like to meet and take photos along with Disney Characters then Enchanted Garden is the place for you because they come to your table and greet everyone-- that is an advantage if you would like to be up close and personal with these characters, no need to line up like those at the park. We had one breakfast at Chef Mickeys and the other at the Enchanted Garden. I like Enchanted Garden the fod and ambiance of Enchanted Garden more. Dining hours for breakfast at the 1st floor of Disneyland Hotel has two rounds: 8-930 am and the other 10 am to 11:30 am. It's better to choose the first round as park hours starts at 10:30am and you wouldn't want to miss your time while you are there. This is the drawback for taking a breakfast at the Enchanted Garden. Your time is limited. In the meantime, dining hours for Chef Mickey's starts at 7am to 10 am - you can show up anytime during those times. Prepare to take photos even at breakfast. 3. Unless you specify they will give only one pillow for every person in the room. We were given only 4 pillows for 4 adults. See to it that you specify your requirements upon check-in. 4. We found out that the shop inside the hotel have some items/clothes on sale. Take advantage of this as some were taged only for 3 for HK$100 instead of the usual HK$160 or HK$180 per item at the park. I also found out that Disney store inside the airport are much cheaper than those at the park. Sad to say, I have limisted HK$ left and bought most of what I needed inside the park. Now I know better.... 5. No room service, no fitness center and spa at this hotel. The fitness center and the spa are located at the other hotel- the Disneyland Hotel not at the Hollywood hotel. So in both visits, I have to be picked up from the Hollywood hotel to the Disney hotel. I was thankful as it's complimentary. Watch out though as a simple Swedish massage can cost you HK$900++ for an hour (approximately more than U$D110). As a spa consultant, this is another story. More of this when I review their Victorian inspired spa. 6. There are no health/medical care center or day care center only an activity center for kids. But then again, who would want to leave their kids behind such a place as this? 7. There are a lot of nice spots at the back of the Hollywood hotel overlooking the HK bay. So walk outside the hotel lobby and get farther down --- after the piano-shaped pool. 8. Not for people who loves the nightlife or downtown clubs and shopping. This is more of a fantasy, children's park/place and for families, childlike adults like me..... 9. At the back of the hotel are more picturesque views like those vintage cars, the view of HK bay with tall buidlings, etc. So prepare to take photos and do not leave your camera behind. 10. There was a cute animal designed towel inside the toilet and did not realize until I arrived home that there is a workshop on how you can learn to make towel design animals at the other hotel (Prince Eric activities room at the Disneyland hotel) and there is also a demonstration on how you can prepare paper mirror with decorative effect available for the whole family including teens. There are a lot of good activities to attend inside the hotel (activities only lasts about 30-45 minutes) only if you read the hotel information paper- just ask the concierge for a copy. 11. If you are a first time visitor in HK here is my tip for you to maximize your stay: stay for two days at Disney Hollywood Hotel, then another two days at the other Disney hotel spend all of these four days either at the park or just enjoying the hotel's amenities, food at the park and activities and then stay in another downtown hotel for another three days to experience tours and trips to other HK destinations including the monastery, cable car rides, downtown shopping, Ocean Park, helicopter ride, etc. All in all, in order to maximize your travel to HK, you need a minimum of seven days. So far what I have read from almost all of the reviews of others were true so its really good to read and get to know what people have experienced before you book your hotel here as this is not the hotel or place for everyone. In my case, I have no grand expectations except to write or blog about my experiences here, learn something new from my field, do a bit of some business and be a child again...and because I wil be returning soon, next time I would try the other hotel- the Disney hotel.....", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "China", "Title": "\u201cdisney hotel is the best..\u201d", "Author": "ChinaRockstar", "ReviewID": "UR68411275", "Content": "Disneyland hotel is the best hotel in hongkong.This hotel is full of leisure.comfort and entertainment for childrens and teenagers.I will surely recommend this hotel to others , so that they can also enjoy the ultimate leisure which i enjoyed there.The only problem i face was problem of food.I could'nt get any indian food available there.but it is full of entertainment for childrens and there parents.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cHotel for Small & Big Kids\u201d", "Author": "OrawanK", "ReviewID": "UR68403694", "Content": "My children loves this hotel.

Same goes for the hotel staff. Only two were smiley, the front desk lady that checked me in (although assigned me the wrong room) and the lady that did the make-up for our little gal (our little gal took the \"little princess\" makeover and photoshoot session).

For some, this might be a little too much Disneyland but it was my 7 yo first trip abroad. I am very picky at hotels and would only stay at Sofitel or Makati Shang in Manila. So Disneyland Hotel was the hotel of choice and not Hollywood Hotel. Arrived at the hotel before 10am as we took the 620am flight out of Manila. Check in was easy and hassle free. I attribute this to the day we checked in - Monday. We were given a room immediately. I asked for a Star Guest pass and received the pass, a roll of stickers, a birthday badge (for my 7 yo) and more stickers. Who could ask for more? Our room was the cheapest one - Garden View. It was comfortable for 4 people as it had 2 double beds. Considerably bigger by HK standards. Bathroom has a bathtub, a spacious counter and was roomy overall. Housekeeping was very prompt, a 10 min wait is long. I asked for 4 more sets of pillows, 2 sets of toiletries, an additional bathrobe and extra slippers for my 7 yo. All my requests were attended to with utmost promptness and courtesy. We got a rabbit for the animal towel and a towel cake plus birthday card for my bday celebrant. We enjoyed the pool. They had an outdoor and an indoor pool. However, the towels seem to have been left out in the open a day too long as they stink. The Mickey Maze was fun as well. We went out on a Monday and my daughter had the maze all to herself. Next to the maze is a gate that leads out to a pathway along the South China Sea. My dad enjoyed this space every morning, as he wakes up very early in the morning. He would sit by the sea and enjoy the sunrise with his morning paper while waiting for us sleepyheads to wake up. Even 67 year olds have a place to go! The food is another story. It was monotonous, imagine staying for 5 days and eating the same breakfast. There are cheaper dining options by Hollywood Hotel. Consider going there for lunch or dinner. Chef Mickey is good by itself. Hollywood and Dine is the fastfood restaurant. Not too many choices here though. We tried the Character Bfast at Enchanted Garden. Was a bit disappointed as there was only Mickey, Goofy and Pluto. We were hoping to see Minnie, Donald or Daisy instead of the 2 dogs. I think you'll have more luck with dinner as we saw Winnie and Minnie one time. Or better yet, ask ahead and make sure the characters you want to see would be there when you are. I honestly don't think that the buffets are overpriced for the place. Most expensive buffet was at HK$250 or around P1500. This is cheaper than Makati Shang or Sofitel. Buy your merchandise at the hotel shops so you dont have to lug them around at the park. Although for hotel guests, you can ask the park shops to deliver your purchases to your hotel. The hotel shops have mostly whats available in the park. If they dont have it, you can ask them to get it. I also availed of the pay 510 for 600 purchase offer. Browse the HKDL website for other offers as well. By the way, they run Disney the whole day in one channel. So be prepared to watch Chip and Dale episodes over and over again. They have free internet in the rooms though. So you can entertain yourself with your laptop once the television has been sequestered. The other days we werent at the park, we were out shopping. We spent one day at Tsim Sha Tsui for good ole haggle shopping. Another day we spent exploring Ngong Ping Cable Cars and the Citigate Outlet Malls. This is very accessible to HKDL. HKDL has their own MTR stop. You will see the MTR station before you even get to the HKDL entrance. Take the very Mickey train to Tung Chung. From here, you cant miss the outlet malls and the cable cars. The Outlet Mall has a floor dedicated to sports wear. You'll find Nike, Adidas, World Balance, Puma, Reebok, K Swiss. They have great brands like Mango, Giordano, Clarks, Coach. You can spend a whole day here so bring plastic money. If you need to save some money, eat your meals at Tung Chung. There's KFC, McDonalds and most other good restaurants. You can even go out after the fireworks and still make dinner at Tung Chung, its that near! HKDL runs their shuttle service until 12 midnight. So no worries about going back to the hotel at all. You can make arrangements if you plan to arrive past 12 midnight so they can pick you up. Only real complain I have is that 2 people from our party got what looked like bedbug bites.

Family-friendly facilities with indoor & outdoor pool with water slides, playground, garden with maze, numerous activities for the children around the hotel and Disney character at the hotel lobby at certain timings for photo taking. The lobby store sells Disney souvenirs too although you can find a wider variety at the park itself. Pros of shopping at the hotel would be it\u2019s less crowded at the hotel & you can leave the merchandise at the hotel instead of carrying it all the way with you if you buy from the park. I realised I got the wrong size for my girl\u2019s T- shirt which I bought at the park when I was packing my luggage & they allow customers to change at the hotel\u2019s store without the need to return to the same store at the park for exchange. Rooms are kids-friendly with 2 queen size beds in the room (connecting rooms available upon request). Spacious & cozy bathrooms with well stock-up of toiletries. Very thoughtful to provide a standing stool for young kids & plastic cup although not sure why only 1 is provided so my young twins had to take turns to use the cup. Slippers (for guest to bring home) and bathrobes are available for the kids as well. The TV size is good and you can get Disney Cartoon TV channels for kids. The only flaw with the room would be the dusty drawers & cabinets. I pulled out a coaster from the drinks cabinet and to my surprise, dirt started flying before my eyes & the coaster is also covered in dust. Disneyland is very near to the airport so the trip from airport cost only HKD110. It\u2019s a wiser choice compared to taking train as you have to change train 2 times before you reach the park & then hop on to the free shuttle bus to the hotel (every 10-15 mins interval) dragging your luggage all the way. I wonder why Disneyland station wasn\u2019t being placed in a more strategic MTR line. The shuttle bus service is just outside the hotel covering 3 areas in the order of Disneyland Park -> Disneyland hotel -> Disney\u2019s Hollywood hotel.

They have stickers for the kids as well as hotel activities like bedtime stories in a function room at 9PM. The pool was huge and heated, and children can play in a bigger part of the pool (unlike other hotel where the kids are is a tiny space). Truly, there isnt a more child friendly hotel than this. The food was also good. It is a bit expensive since there is no restaurant outlet outside the park, but it was also OK. You wont feel cheated out of your HK100 for a meal since it was enough. Breakfast at Enchanted Garden was wonderful! The added bonus was that the food was great. American, Indian, and Chinese selections were very tasty.

Of course, they loved the playroom and the maze. When the kids were asleep, it was convenient for hubby and I to sneak out for a quick drink at the Sorcerer's Lounge which was open till 12:30 AM. Some tips: If your celebrating a special birthday, take the celebration package for a night -the decor in the room and dinner with the Characters along with cake and other freebies was a great experience for the family. Take the 8:30 - 10:30 PM slot as most of the guests are gone by 9:30 and only a few guests are still dining. Hence, MIckey and pals have few tables to greet - including yours which result in lots of pictures. With this, we didn't even need to line up to take pictures with the Characters when we were in the Resort. Book in advance for the restaurant as it gets filled up. Purchase the Star Pass - you'll love the convenience in the Resort. In the Resort, use the fast track machine as much as you can to avoid long lines. When you buy something in the stores, you can ask the Cashier to deliver the goods to your Disney Hotel so you need not lug around heavy packages while going around the Resort. When your in the hotel, ask reception if you can get a star guest lineyard for the kids - there's lots of freebies and surprises both at the Resort and at the hotel. Characters visit the Hotel Lobby after park hours and at 11:00 AM. Bring your camera and be ready to smile a lot. For tourists to HK (like myself) who don't want to bring home extra HK Dollars, you can opt to pay in cash first - yes, including the coins and pay the balance via credit card. Don't forget to reserve at least HK$200.00 for airport cab.

They were always good-mannered, genuinely kind and friendly, and did anything to accommodate a guests request. This aspect alone made the stay so worth the extra money, as you hardly receive service like this anymore. We checked in with Crystal at the front desk, who upgraded us to a balcony room, supplied us with 3 door keys (one for each person), took her time personally explaining all about the hotel and theme park facilities and making paperwork easy and hassle-free, all with a smile on her face and a cheerful disposition. We were overly impressed before we even reached our room, and when we got there, we were even more so! Our room was spacious, well appointed and immaculately clean.

Again, the staff shined through for us on many occasions. We had previously shopped a lot in Kowloon (who wouldn't!) and were worried that our bags would be over the airline limit. When rung, Bell services happily appeared at our room in less than 5 minutes and took our bags to be weighed with a smile on their face. They returned in less than 20 minutes with all of our bags, little tags with handwritten weights attached to each one. They did this on not 1, but 2 occasions for us, for which we were extremely grateful! Although it is their job to deal with such requests, they did it with a cheerful and helpful disposition, and did not seem upset by the request in the least. Another instance of outstanding customer service is when my sister and I were left in the room to await Bell Services to pick up our bags. Our mum decided to leave the room and begin the checkout process, taking our room key (which is used to direct power to the room) with her, leaving us in total darkness. When the lovely bellboy Helson arrived, he cheerfully took our bags, happily chatting and telling jokes, then offered to let us borrow his key so that we could turn the lights on and see to make sure we hadn't left anything behind! You don't get this kind of thoughtfulness in many places anymore. Most bellboys would have been happy to leave us in the dark. Checkout was equally efficient and kind, even at the ungodly hour of 6am. The only complaint we had about the hotel was that the food was outrageously expensive, and seeing as the resort is sort of in the middle of nowhere, you really have no choice but to eat it if you don't want to starve. However, this was the only thing that bothered us about the place, and it was a very minor issue. If we had of known beforehand, we would have brought some cup noodles and snacks with us. If you are intending to visit Hong Kong Disneyland, splurge and spend a night or two at this hotel. For the service alone, the fee is well worth it!", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely magical time in the magical Kingdom!\u201d", "Author": "BeadyEyes", "ReviewID": "UR54560388", "Content": "Visited Disneyland & stayed 1 night @ Disneyland Hotel in early Dec 09.

Everything went smoothly although the check-in process was a little convoluted to me. Had to sign so many things! Dumped our valuables in the hotel safe & were @ the Park by 1030am. Pls see separate review for HK Disneyland. The hotel was nicely designed with all the necessary Disney motifs. Our kids loved it! The rooms were very spacious, unusually so in HK. We also had interconnecting rooms so that was great for the kids. The room service food was actually pretty good, to our surprise! The Characters Breakfast is a must.. yes its pricey, but hey, its Disneyland. The spread was decent and the kids get to take all the pictures they want without having to queue.. so that was great. There was a special promotion so we could go back to the Park the next morning, spent a few hrs there before heading back to hotel to pick up luggage & then straight to the airport. Its extremely convenient to go to the airport by taxi & took us abt 20mins in all. The one thing the hotel could not accommodate us was a check-out beyond 12pm cos they were fully booked!

You couldn't have it any better. 2. Surroundings: Green foliage all around. Coming from Dubai this was like going to a tropical rain forest. But that aside the trees and the greenery was just awesome. We got a garden facing room and for the only time during the trip my wife said- the view is nice! Kind of made up for the whole trip. 3. Service: Staff is very courteous. Difficult to imagine people can be like this. The service was excellent- at check in- Katy was very polite and helpful, room service, housekeeping, restaurants- Taka in the breakfast place, concierge services every one was great. 4. Food: The breakfast is nice, though a little steep. But the Disney characters moving about more than make up for it. The kids loved Mickey, Goofy and Pluto - we got tired eventually of the photographs we took. The spread in the breakfast is very large. The banana bread is amazing. We had dinner in the lobby restaurant and surprises of all surprises they had north Indian food- the kids were longing for something which could be near home cooked food- and this hit the spot. Again the service here was exceptional. 5. Disney Store: If you forget to buy anything in the Park then can buy it from the in-house Disney store. 6. Park: The Park is unlike the Paris DL. It's small and has kiddy rides only- in other words it's manageable and perfect. There was no rush and we did Dumbo the Flying Elephant twice- can't beat that. Last time in Paris stood in line for 45 minutes for a 3 minute ride. Did the Mad Hatter's Tea Cups thrice- within 15 minutes. Just awesome.

There's a Victorian Spa onsite which has a nice quiet spa ambience but with prices on the high side. I was suprised that they didnt offer discounts off the spa menu even during off peak. Jacuzzi, steam and sauna is free for spa guests but HKD100 for non spa guests. Also, a gym, indoor and outdoor pool. Hotel has a \" Kid's club\" that teaches kids how to draw disney characters, magic, tell bedtimes stories during specified hours only. Downside - There is very little for adults to do after dinner other than drinks at the hotel lounge or when the park closes at 7.30pm around the hotels.

The theme park is smaller and more tame then other Disneylands, but all that said, in three days we didn't see everything with our 2 year old in tow (with older children I think they might get bored after a few day in the park and a day by the pool???)", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cBreath taking view of the ocean\u201d", "Author": "dd_m29", "ReviewID": "UR32088165", "Content": "part of HK disneyland though not attached. it is an oasis of peace. if you do get a top room you are sure to enjoy the calm of the sea when you get up early morning. a family place with lots of activity even in the lobby keeps eveyone young at heart. the coach service to the park is convenient but perhaps would be better if access was easier especially for people who may need a wheel chair. a rather good alternate in case the US one cannot be managed", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cBlow the budget, this hotel is worth every cent!\u201d", "Author": "tric1003", "ReviewID": "UR31933969", "Content": "We (2 adults and 2 children aged 7 and 9) stayed here for 2 nights at the end of May. Before I made the booking via the internet I was considering the Hollywood Hotel due to it's cheaper rates and excellent reviews on this forum. And now I have absolutely no regrets about spending the extra $$ and staying at the DisneyLand Hotel. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable, from the bell boys to the Concierge Staff to the Front Desk staff and the Housekeeping staff (they are all called Cast Members). Nothing was a problem and all our requests were handled with a smile and efficiency. All Cast Members greet the hotel guests with a cheery \"Have a magical day\", even on the telephone when I called for more towels! This did get a bit strange after a while but does show the dedication and excellent standards maintained by the management of the property. It definitely is a family oriented property with all small guests being paid special attention to and constantly being given Disney stickers by the staff. The Hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous. The lobby is breathtaking and the grounds are amazing. We stayed for 2 nights and I regret not booking an extra night just so that we could have enjoyed the facilities and what the resort had to offer. Most of our days were spent at the fantastic DisneyLand Park and Ngong Ping and Citigate Outlets, so we felt as though we barely got a chance to enjoy the hotel. The pools are fantastic. The outdoor pool has fast and fun waterslide which provided hours of amusement for me and my children, even until 10pm when there are still lifeguards on duty. The indoor pool is lovely, designed like a Roman bath. We enjoyed doing laps there. The Prince Eric childrens activity room had lots of supervision for the kids with loads of interesting activities to occupy them. They even had bedtime stories nightly at 8pm. From 11am daily a Princess visits the Lobby for photos with guests. It was wonderful for my daughter to have such an opportunity after having to queue up for ages at DisneyLand and to only be able to spend a few minutes (2 photos) with the Princesses there out of fairness to all the others in queue. The gift shop sells very reasonably priced Disney merchandise and has a huge variety. We visited the Hollywood Hotel's shop and found that it carried a much smaller range. The prices of the merchandise are the same at DisneyLand, and both the hotels so I would recommend that you purchase from the Hotel to save yourself having to fight the crowds at the Park and then have to carry your purchases around. You can even charge your purchases to your room account. We booked a Character Breakfast at the Enchanted Garden restaurant which was expensive especially since my youngest was too excited to eat, but it was worth it for the Disney experience. Also the variety of food was amazing - it was a truly international buffet with bench islands dedicated to Japanese, Chinese, Indian food as well as salads, cereals, pastries, bread and fruit. It was huge! Our room was a Garden Room with fabulous views over the Mickey Maze and also the ocean. The room was definitely large enough for all 4 of us and we slept 2 to a bed very comfortably. The rooms are immaculate as are the bathrooms which are well stocked with toiletries and posh fluffy towels. There are bathrobes in the wardrobe for everyone and slippers for you to keep. My daughter celebrated a birthday in May and housekeeping left her a birthday card and a birthday cake sculpted from a towel. It was a lovely gesture. And at the end of our stay, Housekeeping advised that the birthday cake was a gift! I was really touched especially considering all the other \"gifts\" which were complimentary. Due to rainy weather we weren't keen to walk to DisneyLand but my husband did and it's only a 10 minute walk along beautifully paved and landscaped gardens. We didn't go to Inspiration Lake because of the weather but would have if we had stayed another night. We did visit the Hollywood Hotel and it looked fantastic as well, with a huge pool and beautifully landscaped gardens and loads of childrens play equipment. The meals looked more reasonably priced than at the DisneyLand Hotel and had a greater variety of dining options. We would have been more than happy staying at the Hollywood Hotel but were thrilled to be at the DisneyLand Hotel. The shuttle buses to and from the Hotels to DisneyLand public transport interchange are clean and efficient and reliable. It was another bonus of staying here as we used the shuttle to take us to the MTR to explore the other parts of Lantau Island. The Ngong Ping Cable Car ride and Citigate Outlets are definitely worth a visit but avoid the Ngong Ping village which is ghastly. My only complaint would be that the cost of eating at DisneyLand Hotel was expensive and did not represent value for money. We would have liked more choices for smaller meals and snacks as often we would be coming back to the Hotel for a quick refresher before heading out again. Overall we had a terrific time at this property and enjoyed the total Disney experience. DisneyLand itself was just perfect for my children's age group as the rides weren't too scary and the park was large enough without being daunting. I would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel to anyone and everyone wanting to experience the Disney magic and we hope to return soon.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Experience\u201d", "Author": "Audrey9", "ReviewID": "UR31077925", "Content": "This was the last stop of a big family holiday and the whole Disneyland experience was made even better by staying at this luxury hotel.

My partner and I both worked at the original Disneyland back in the days when service was more important that profit, so we are both VERY picky when it comes to all things Disney. We expect a lot from Disney and we're not very forgiving when paying the premium prices Disney charges for their deluxe resorts. We have been to all of the Disneylands in the world and have stayed at many of Disney's deluxe resorts, including the Grand Floridian on which this property is based. So, with that said, I can say without a doubt that THIS Disneyland hotel is the finest example of what Disney can do to create a magcal experience. There is simply no better Disney hotel in the world and I do not make that statement lightly. Anyone who thinks this hotel is overpriced has not stayed at other Disney hotels. We stayed for four nights in a Fantasia room and it was less than one-third the price of what we paid at the Grand Floridian for a regular room. Not only that, but the food was priced reasonably and every single dish we had during our stay was excellent. We ordered room service every night after we returned tired from the park and it arrived so quickly I have no idea how it was possible to cook it and deliver it in such a short amount of time. It was delivered by the most gracious cast members we have ever encountered and the food was hot and beautifully presented. The moment we put the tray/table out in the hallway it was picked up. The same was true of the breakfast buffet in the morning. Although limited everything was outstanding and there was never a wait. We did not go to the character breakfast, but we did check it out one morning and there was no wait there either. There were always one or more Disney princesses in the lobby greeting people and taking photos day and night. We were astounded that they were always available and the way they interacted with the children was marvelous even by Disney standards. The hotel is similar in design to the Grand Floridian, but on a much smaller scale. There are only 400 rooms here all in the main building, so it has a much more intimate feel to it and there were never crowds. The Disney details in the design were amazing...Cinderella's glass slipper in the crystal chandeliers, Mickey's head inlaid in the stone floors, characters faces woven into the carpets, etc. You could spend all day just looking for the hidden Mickeys. Generally one pays dearly for Disney hotels, but the service doesn't quite measure up to the price. Not so here. We had service so attentive even we were amazed. For example, our first night we put some dirty clothes in the laundry bag and left it in the closet intending to add to it later. That afternoon housekeeping called to be sure we didn't intend to send it out because the maid had notice it. That alone was amazing. We said that we would send it out on our last day there and forgot about it. On our last full day, housekeeping called to ask if our laundry was ready to send out! We were astounded that not only did someone make a note of our off-hand comment, but they actually followed up on it. We have stayed at some very upscale places and none has ever been THAT on top of things. Most cast members we dealt with spoke very good English and the few who didn't immediately went and got someone who could help us. The cast members at the hotel and all of Hong Kong Disneyland were the friendliest we have ever encountered. Literally every single one of them during our four day stay greeted us when we walked by even when they could have easily avoided eye contact. We've never seen anything like it. Even the woman dusting the floors said hello to us, twice! We asked if we could see the other types of rooms available and that resulted in us beign taken on a private tour of the entire hotel to visit every type of room. Other than the Fantasia rooms that are in the turrets and have king sized beds and a Jacuzzi bathtub, all of the other rooms are identical. We'd say go for the Fantasia room if you can because you will have more floor space for children to play. The other rooms were beautiful, but seemed a bit cramped for a family. The Kingdom Club level has a beautiful lounge area serving breakfast and snacks. It was MUCH nicer than the similar lounge and the Grand Floridian. The rooms on the Kingdom Club floor have TV's in the bathrooms and views of the park, but are otherwise the same, so we're not sure they would be worth the extra cost. The Fantasia rooms have panoramic ocean views with windows on two sides and we were very happy with that. Disney hotels generally charge for every little thing, but here there was free wired high-speed internet and bottled water. We also received a room full of towel animals and a tin of cookies for a birthday we happened to mention to a cast member in the morning. There is a large themed pool area outside with a playground area for children and a stunning indoor pool as well. We didn't use the spa, but did look at it and it was very nicely done. There is a free shuttle bus to the park, but after using it once we found that we prefered to walk to the park along the beautifully landscaped Park Promenade. The walk takes about fifteen minutes at a leisurely pace and features lovely fountains and Disney music playing along the entire route. Hardly anyone used this walkway which is a shame because it really is beautiful. If the Disneyland Hotel is too pricey for you, try Disney's Hollywood Hotel instead. We were given a tour of that hotel also and it is very well done. It has a more frantic feel to it, but the service was outstanding, the rooms well designed (sort of like a cruise ship stateroom) and there are many more food options there including a food court that the Disneyland Hotel lacks. We really thought that booking four days here would be too long, but the entire experience was so wonderful we didn't want to leave. We don't use the term \"magical\" very often, but the entire resort was just that. Yes, the park is small, but that forced us to do the little things that we haven't done in years at the established parks. We LOVED it. Even as jaded ex-cast members we were won over by the whole experience here. What the park lacks in attractions it fully makes up for in charm and friendliness. If all you want to do is run from attraction to attraction, this probably isn't the Disneyland Resort for you, but if you want a truly magical experience on a scale that you and your children will find enchanting, then this is the place.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "perth", "Title": "\u201cOver priced especially for Families\u201d", "Author": "PerthBogga", "ReviewID": "UR28581562", "Content": "The hotel is beautiful, and magical.

As a guest of the hotel the Disney experience doesnt stop when you leave the park in the evening. Every single thing exceeds your expectation.

Breakfast either at the \"Enchanted Garden Character Buffet\" where Mickey, Goofy Pluto are there wearing chefs clothes and Miney or Daisy would be there too ( never donald i dont know why) you buy the breakfast brochure everyday for the next day (or all at once but i liked that I get the option instead of a package) the food however is O.K. not to yummy yet very PRICY so we didn't go to it to often (besides your not able to eat two mouthfuls without a character jumping in you face for a photo ) and very noisy too.

I loved ( well my daughter loved) that after breakfast at the lobby everyday around 10.30-11.30 we find a disney princess where we stand in a short line and her two assistance help us take a photo with her. the gift shop is great too. The garden maze was lots of fun also there is a long walk near the ocean that was wonderful and peaceful, a small playground ( for toddlers maybe) we didn't get to swim at the pool but it looked very clean and lots of fun for kids with its large slide. The shuttle bus takes you to Disneypark and MTR( subway) station every 10 minutes (a few minutes ride) very organized and efficient when it was very crowded (during Chinese new year there were many busses going to and from the park at once).

We are a family with two kids ages 5 and 6 (turning 7 in a few weeks). I have been to Hong Kong numerous times but this was the first trip for my husband and the kids. Originally we planned to stay at the Disneyland Hotel for 2 nights, then the Kowloon Shangri-la for another two. However, once we arrived at the Disneyland Hotel, the kids immediately fell in love -- their first comment was: \u201cthis hotel looks so familiar, just like the one in San Diego!\u201d. Well, the hotel is indeed a replica of the historic Hotel del Coronado (less than 30 minutes from our house in San Diego), which we frequently visit. The kids kept on insisting that they wanted to stay there for the whole time (they may be a bit homesick after seeing the hotel), so we finally gave in and stayed for 4 nights. In the beginning I was quite reluctant to give up our reservation at the Shangri-la, as we booked a harbor view suite to celebrate our 15th anniversary (Shangri-la was fantastic and did not charge us for the cancellation!). I also felt that staying 5 days at Disney was not my idea of an authentic Hong Kong experience for our kids. However, the kids absolutely loved this hotel and were very very happy with everything it has to offer and we ended up having a good time. The hotel is beautiful, the ground meticulously landscaped, and there\u2019s a nice walking path along the shore of the South China Sea and lots of room for the kids to roam about. So we had a surprisingly peaceful, relaxing, and pleasant stay. Since many of the previous reviews have offered excellent information on the rooms, the restaurants, and hotel amenities already, I will focus this review on the rooms and services at the Kingdom Club. When we booked our stay, we took the advice from several people on this forum and purchased an Hong Kong Disneyland annual pass for my son for hotel and dining discounts. With the pass we had a choice of either 35% discount off hotel rooms during weekdays, or paying rack rate for a guaranteed upgrade to the Kingdom Club suite. Since we needed two rooms we decided to purchase the premium pass for the upgrade and we were very happy that we did so. The Kingdom Club is located at the 7th floor of the hotel, with its own check-in desk, dedicated concierge, and a private dining room. The dining room is the main gathering place for the Kingdom Club guests. It serves a very nice buffet breakfast, drinks and snacks throughout the day and appetizers in the evenings, all complementary. It also offered several newspapers in 3 different languages (Chinese, English, and Japanese) and bedtime stories for the kids. The buffet breakfast was very good, with typical western breakfast items (including cereals, eggs, ham, sausages, hash brown, smoked salmon, a variety of pastries, bread, fruits) and traditional Cantonese breakfast items (such as dim sum, fried noodles and rice congee). The appetizers in the evenings were equally good, with a variety of finger foods, pastries, dessert, fruits, and some luxurious items such as seared tuna, finger sandwiches with crab salad; drink choices included wine, sparkling water (Perrier and San Pelligrino), soft drinks, and beer. They also served snacks, drinks and fruits throughout the day. This arrangement was extremely convenient for us as our kids could just stop by at the Kingdom Club whenever they wanted a something to eat. In the evenings you can view the fireworks from the dining room or the balcony while munching on yummy appetizers. A couple nights we were so full we decided to skip dinner and just ordered a few small dishes from room service. Our suite was roomy, and very nicely (and tastefully) decorated. In the living room there is a large sleeper sofa and two chairs, an armoire with a flat-screen TV with DVD player, a dining table for 4, a minibar, a coffee maker, and a safe. In the living room there\u2019s a half bathroom right by the entrance, and opposite the half-bath there\u2019s a connecting door to another guestroom so it could potentially become a two-bedroom suite. The bedroom has two double beds, another flat-screen TV with DVD player, a desk, a chest drawer, and a very large bathroom with a separate shower, a Jacuzzi bathtub, a separate vanity with chair. The room is extremely nice with tons of drawers and more than enough storage space for our family of 4. The only complain I could even think of is that there\u2019s only one sink in the bathroom, instead of the customary two in most high-end western hotels. The suite also comes with two small balconies and our room has beautiful views of the South China Sea, Kowloon, Hong Kong and a few offshore islands, and the bridges connecting Lantau island to the mainland. At night we often sat on the balcony with a drink and just looked at the lights from the city and the boats. So it was unexpectedly relaxing for my husband and I. The hotel (and Hollywood hotel as well) offers 2nd day free Disneyland park ticket deal for its guests. This turns out to be great for us, as our kids could only do a few hours of sightseeing everyday, and they did get tired from the 30-40 minute subway ride back and forth into town. We did hit most of the usual tourist attractions such as the Peak Tram, Star Ferry, Avenue of Stars, double-decker bus, the Ngong Ping cable car, etc. but in the afternoon the kids just wanted to spend a few hours in Disneyland, hang out at the hotel, or run around the Mickey Mouse maze. Although I have to say that Hong Kong Disneyland itself was very small and non-descript (what people said in the forum are true!). It\u2019s hard to understand why they selected this incredible seaside location, built a dedicated Mickey Mouse train to connect to the main MTR line, built two beautiful hotels and a nice lake for paddle boating, and, a small, mediocre park??!! There were only 10-15 rides in total and you can walk around the park in less than an hour. Anyhow, our kids loved all the rides, the parade, Lion King and Mickey Mouse shows and we could tell they this really the highlights of their vacation in Hong Kong. We realized that instead of packing our daily schedule with a sightseeing hit-list with whiny kids, it is simply more enjoyable to slow down and treasure the moment as a family. The kids were so happy every day and this is more important for us than going to one more temple or museum. On our fourth day it rained in the morning so we decided to stay in. We discovered that there\u2019s a kids club at the hotel and my kids decided to go check it out. It offers organized activities throughout the day but kids need to be accompanied by their parents. It is really geared toward little kids and my son quickly grew bored and I decided to take him into Kowloon for some sightseeing and shopping. My daughter loved it and ended up staying there for two hours while my husband tried to finish up a book sitting on a Mickey Mouse chair. Several of the princess characters came to visit the kids club and she later had a tea party with Cinderella and Snow White by herself. The characters chatted with her for a very long time and she was truly happy. The characters seemed to hang out in the lobby every so often to greet the guests and later on she also met Alice (in the wonderland) and Mulan in the lobby. Needless to say this was the highlight of my daughter\u2019s entire Asia trip! The concierge service at the Kingdom club was fantastic! We frequently stay at 5-star hotels such as the Four Seasons and I would say that the concierge service was better than ANY hotel we\u2019ve stayed in. One afternoon my husband and I decided that we\u2019ve had enough of the room service food and overpriced resort restaurants, and that we should go into town for a nice dinner. As we were flipping through our guide books, I thought a dinner at Felix at the Peninsula Hotel with a view of Victoria Harbor will make up for my husband\u2019s having to spend our anniversary at Disneyland (he originally wanted to go to Bali but I talked him into going to Hong Kong. Even though he did not complain I knew this was far from his idea of spending our anniversary). I remember it was pass 2pm in the afternoon when I walked into the Kingdom Club and told the concierge about my dinner plan. As I was talking to the concierge I realized we also needed a babysitter for the kids. The concierge smiled and said he would try his best, he just had to make a few phone calls to see whether he could find us a babysitter (the hotel has a 24-hr advanced reservation policy). While he was on the phone, another concierge called the Peninsula, told them she had two VIP guests celebrating anniversary, then apparently the call was transferred to another person and she started speaking rapidly in Cantonese. A few minutes later she told us that she was able to secure us a table with a view. At 5:30pm our sitter arrived, after spending some time with the sitter to make sure our kids were in good hands, my husband and I started our 40-minute trek to Kowloon. At 7pm we were seated at one of the best tables at Felix on the 28th floor of the Peninsula Hotel, right by the window, with unobstructed view of the Victoria Harbor. We toasted champagne, had a fantastic 3-course dinner, and watched Symphony of Lights together. It was truly a memorable evening and it took a team of dedicated and capable concierge to make it happen! Even though our vacation plan was unexpectedly modified by our kids, it was overall a very nice, enjoyable vacation. The Disneyland Hotel is truly a gem, and I will highly recommend this hotel, especially the Kingdom Club, to any family with small children as a comfortable alternative base from the rest of the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cWell, it's Disney :)\u201d", "Author": "PKa", "ReviewID": "UR25062986", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights on Feb 09.

This time we stayed at the Victorian Style Disneyland Hotel instead of the Hollywood Hotel since we've been there twice. I tried to booked us at the Fantasia Room but was dissappointed to know that it was fully booked due to the golden week holidays in China. The Sea View and the Kingdom Club Rooms were offered to me and I opted to take the Sea View room being much cheaper then plus my wife would go on a fit if she found out how much I \"splurged\" on my year-end pay. On the day we came, there were lots of people from the mainland as guests but surprisingly their check-in queue was much faster than the other hotel eventhough there were more people in comparison with our previous stays. As expected due to their number of guests, we weren't given our rooms yet so we took our tickets and went to the park. The park was all jam-packed with people on every corner and we were not able to take all of the rides or see some of the shows like the Lion King, the boat ride to Tarzan's house or the Disney Parade even when we stayed until 9PM. We did not get the \"play for 2 days\" ticket because the golden week were considered special holidays. As we went back to the hotel to get our keys for the Seaview Room; I secretly wished that the front desk would give us an upgrade to the Kingdom Club Room for free at least to make our stay a bit better. Disney's magic seemed to have worked as the clerk at the front-desk informed me then that we were upgraded to the Kingdom Club Room! So we got freebies to boot like evening snacks, breakfast, morning and afternoon tea/snacks etc.. As a result, I cancelled the buffet breakfast for the following morning. I actually saved money on this trip! My wife and kids did not seemed to understand when I told them about the upgrade; (I saw the rooms at their website) till they saw the room themselves. The bathroom was simply beyond their words with my 6 year old daughter squealing that they had a TV inside the bathroom too! So she and her little brother stayed longer at the tub while watching their cartoons. The beds were soft and fluffy and had extra pillows hidden at the media cabinet. I loved the balcony with the romantic view of the sea and over-looking their outdoor swimming pool, it had chairs for you to sit on while you breathe all that fresh air, I think. The outdoor pool was closed for maintenance but we got to use their indoor pool and had it to ourselves since it appears no one knew about the indoor pool. My kids were also pleasantly surprised about the snacks at the Kingdom Club Lounge as well and had an eating binge or was that just me. I normally pay attention to the desserts table so lots of mini-cakes, cookies and pastries. The free breakfast was also great! I'll give it two words~~~smoked salmon! All in all, our stay at the park may not be that enjoyable because of the holiday crowd but I think we wouldn't get that upgrade if they weren't fully booked, maybe. Disneyland Hotel made our stay memorable that it was the best vacation we had. Just Magical, if you will. The next time, we will definitely take the Kingdom Club rooms and use more of our time at the hotel and lounge.

The hotel itself is beautiful, beautiful lobby, beautiful gardens and rooms. The stay was let down by the quality of the staff and the ambiance of chaos. There were plenty of staff around but very few of them useful. We found many avoided eye contact or simply ignored you so wouldn't have to do any work apart from stand around. The checkin was total chaos. The location of the bell services meant that there were lugguage and people everywhere, blocking you from easily getting to the reception. There was a very minor mix up with my booking but I was shocked by the rudeness and incompetance of the service. Not what I would expect from a supposed 5 star premises. Also the strict 3PM checkin time is a bit self indulgent. We arrived in the early morning on a long haul flight. The hotel would not allow us early check in (in any form!) so we were faced with the options of waiting 5 hours in the crowded lobby or going into Disneyland with 2 tired grumpy kids. I've been faced with similar situations before in my travels but Disneyland Hotel has to be by far the most imcompetant handling of the situation ever. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Our room had a great view of the garden maze and the sea. The all day Disney channels were a huge hit with the kids. The disney toiletries are a nice touch. The food at the hotel is overpriced and very average at best. Because of the location of the hotel being issolated, you're going to have to live with it. The Disney Character breakfast is worthwhile for the kids but be warned the quality of the food is on par with a 3 star hotel. The regular breakfast is of similar low quality offerings with less choice. We found the hotel not well designed for people with disabilities and young children in prams. Apart from the main entrance, all other exits are heavy swing doors, many of them quite narrow. there were also lots of stairs with no ramps or lifts nearby. The hotel has spent a lot of time thinking up fine details such as costumes for staff and mickey mouse motifs on carpets but has spent far too little time in training staff on how to meet the minimal standards of service. This is why the hotel was a let down.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOver Priced Food\u201d", "Author": "megey", "ReviewID": "UR23856412", "Content": "Stayed at the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel for 4 nights in Januray at the end of a month long world trip as a treat for our 3 and 4 year old. The Hotel is clean, easy to reach from airport and also easy to access via public transport as per previous reviews. I do want to say that possibly for Australians the food offer is expensive on our exchange rate - AUD$100 for dinner buffet which is of RSL quality. Breakfast with the characters is great fun but the food is very poor quality - if a 3 and 4 year don't eat a donut with chocolate icing and sprinkles you know something is wrong with it! Children over 3 have to pay for all buffet meals even if 2 adults dining as well - which is a bit rich - they wanted to charge our 3 year old for the afternoon tea buffet when all she ate was half a buttered scone! For a hotel that caters for kids a few more kids deals would be appreciated.They bring out plastic Disney bowls and cutlery for young children - which is a nice touch. No dinner menu for kids - had to order a ham and cheese sandwich which cost AUD$20! Housekeeping is very efficient as is the Front Desk, Bell Desk and Valet but they really need to overhaul the Food and Beverage Department. Never saw a senior chef or manager patrolling the restaurant and observing the buffet and what people were eating. The food inside the park is disgusting - the burger patties are like saw dust so keep away from them! The Novotel Citigate which is very close on the MTR ( get off at Tung Chung) has a great buffet for half the price. I recommend heading there for a meal rather! Tung Chung is an outlet mall so there are a few other food outlets including a great food court which does a nice Korean BBQ.

But I must say, I was in for a surprise, as this was a great hotel and it is much, much better than I expected, and in contrast, was much better than other Disney-affiliated hotels several times over. I had a 4-year-old in my party, and in comparison to other HK hotels I had stayed in during my trip, I could easily say this was the best hotel to stay in with a child, not just for the duration for your stay in the resort, but as a \"hub\" in HK. Many would disagree, due to the long distance between Kowloon/HK Island and the resort, but the MTR's efficient enough to justify. Only about 15-20 minutes to Central. And, as the MTR's so efficient, my group went to the resort via train. And, literally, we got the Disney experience right at the start of our travels - the Disneyland Resort Line on the MTR has dedicated, purpose-built trains that was customised for that Disney look, including Disney windows, doors and decorations! That was a treat in itself! Getting to the hotel was a quick bus ride away from the station - shuttle buses are available for a useful means of transport - 10 mins between buses looping as the Park -> Disneyland Hotel -> Hollywood Hotel -> Park. Check-in was quick and efficient. As we were before check-in time, we were able to drop our bags and head to the park, which I really appreciated. The room in itself is a leap ahead than other hotels in the other Disney parks! They had much, much more attention to detail, with Disney personalisation everywhere, which I would want, because it's Disney. Spacious beds that you can sleep on (unlike other HK hotel beds!), a very decent bathroom, a spacious closet fitted with the typical robes/slippers (and what I found soooooo cute was there was a little bath robe specially for my 4-year-old!), and a plasma. I especially like this room because since I have indicated that I had a kid in my party, and they catered specifically for her. What they failed to realise though is that my 4-year-old is not a baby - while we were in the park, they had put in a crib, a potty, and other several baby-related items though. I could see why they got confused - my 4-year-old got her passport 4 years ago, so they would mistake her picture for a baby, and forgot to check the date of birth! That's OK, though, because I love that little gesture. Broadband Internet was available, like most good hotels, housekeeping attended all my needs, and, as an Australian, was excited to hear that Australia Network was actually available in a hotel! On the subject on TV, most channels are in Putonghua/Cantonese, except for about out of 20 channels. There were the typical Disney Channel and Playhouse Disney as you would expect, but they threw in a Bedtime Stories channel, which I found useful. What I didn't like, though, was that a 24-hour news channel, i.e. CNN or BBCWN, was not available, as one who keeps up with the news, but at least the Bloomberg & CNBC financial channels were available. Room service was efficient, but mediocre and expensive. But that's the norm for most hotels. As I had swapped my booking from the Disneyland Hollywood Hotel to the Disneyland Hotel I did not have a booking for breakfast at the hotel and only at Chef Mickey at the Hollywood Hotel, so I can't vouch for the restaurants at the hotel. But what was great that after eating at Chef Mickey, instead of catching the shuttle bus and going to the park then the hotel, complimentary vans were available to take you directly from the Hollywood Hotel to the Disneyland Hotel. You need to pay for use of the sauna, which is quite stupid. Also, there isn't much else to do at the hotel except go in their pool, which was closed for renovation, and go through their maze, which was small but nice. The Disney Princesses made an appearance by the lobby, whereas at the other Disney hotels I've stayed in only made character appearances at the Character Breakfasts. Check out efficient, as was able to split the bill easily (had booked 4 rooms). All in all, it is a decent hotel.

Although the Disney hotels do not have the sophistication of the other luxurious hotel brands, the Disney spirit always make up for what they fall short in any area. We stayed in this hotel several times before and this was our second time celebrating the new year here. We enjoyed our visit in the past but we were disappointed this time. Disney is selling fantasy. Their staff should keep in mind at all time that they are cast members and their jobs are to \"perform\". Quite a few members we met during our stay were not delivering, they were just doing their jobs like staff of a 3-star hotel. We had New Year's Eve dinner at the Crystal Lotus, the Chinese restaurant. There was set dinner for the night and also a la carte selection on the menu. We asked the waitress if we must order the set dinner. She answered \"yes\" immediately. We asked again why there was a la carte selection on the menu. Then she said if we were given a menu with the a la carte items, we could order that too and she walked away. What?! We stayed on the club floor so breakfast at the Kingdom Club was included. The time for breakfast was until 10:00am only. When we arrived at 9:15am, the club was filled with guests and there was a waiting list for table. We were asked to go back to our room and wait for their call and it was really annoying. Worst of all, the staff did not act apologetic at all. Obviously, it happened all the time. We were finally being seated at the Grand Salon at the lobby for breakfast. When we visited about a year ago, there was free mini-bar for rooms on the club floor. As I recalled, there were a bag of M&M's, a pack of Oreo and a few cans of soft drink. It was nice to have something to munch on while watching TV at night. A small treat contributed a lot to the enjoyment of guests. It was a bad move cancelling this small benefit. When we checked out, we met the same robotic girl who did our check in. Again, she finished the paperwork efficiently but she showed no concern at all about our stay. Other staff were also busy cleaning up the breakfast and they just walked by us without even a greeting or a smile. And it was the New Year Day!!

There were some nice things like the Disney Princesses showing up in the hotel lobby (and not having to wait in long lines at the park), as well as the child's sized bathrobe and slippers in the rooms. The rooms were modest in size but at least the beds were comfortable (some hotels in Asia give you the equivalent of a box spring to sleep on; they're so firm). Here are some things we were a little \"put off\" by: There are no movies to watch in your room (i.e. when you put your little one down to sleep and stay in the room), not even pay-per-view. The \"many\" Disney channels they offer are actually a couple channels of repeat TV shows offered in several languages; the same thing on three channels but one in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. Another irritant was that guests (who were already paying at least $300 USD per night), were asked to pay an additional fee to go into the locker room of the spa and use the whirlpool or sauna. Basically, I could work out in the gym or pool but had to go get cleaned up in my room. What?! I understand having to pay for services like massage, but these were more expensive (and fewer minutes) than anywhere I've found in Asia. Concerning prices, be prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of money on average food. The enticement for their buffet is that the Disney characters come greet you at your table (Mickey, Goofy, Daisy, Pluto...). It is admittedly fun for one meal, even worth the $30 USD per person for breakfast once, but the food was quite average. Dinner prices were $75 USD per person and also only average. This is more than double the money than at some of the very nice buffets at the Grand Californian at the LA Disneyland - where the food and service is much better. Concerning service, it is also passable but again not \"5-star\" and certainly not what westerners might be used to. There is definitely no \"customer is always right\" mentality or even close. I was given misinformation by hotel staff about the availability of suites, misinformation by my travel agent about the items including in our package (which the hotel could have accommodated very easily), and several other things. When I brought some of these things to the attention of management (Grace and Theresa I think), the answer I was given was, \"I understand, but we've only been here a short time\" (referring to the hotel only being in existence for a couple years). I was floored at the response and disappointed at the total disregard for my concerns and no attempt to \"improve our stay\" as they claim they will do. The only final things worth mentioning is that the hotel and park are in the middle of nowhere, so if you want to eat somewhere else, stop by a convenience store, etc. you have to travel pretty far. We felt a bit like prisoners and like we hadn't actually been to Hong Kong. The subway (MRT) is pretty convenient at least. Last but not least, everyone knows that this is the smallest of the Disneyland parks. Young children can enjoy the rides, but teens will likely find it difficult to stay entertained with the lack of adrenaline-inducing rides.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cOnly for disney fans\u201d", "Author": "cendut", "ReviewID": "UR21169172", "Content": "I know most people (if not all) that are staying in this hotel are doing it because they are going to see disneyland.

The hotel itself is gloomy, the tiles and lighting and carpets looks old and dark, made worse by the always cloudy skies when I was staying there. The room service is dissapointing. This is China and even chinese food tasted bad. Not to mention expensive too! I guess me being in the middle of nowhere results in being overcharged for bad food. The breakfast at the enchanted garden/basement restaurant is very expensive by hk standards.. 250 HKD! and it's not that delicious either. The room is ok, in a victorian decor but again, it just feels old dark and... gloomy. Cmon, this is supposed to be the happiest place on earth! at least the tv is big, but they told me the hotel is an all twin bed hotel. the bed was also hard, and having a band playing disney tunes right outside your room well into 10 pm can be a little.. noisy.

The Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel is one of two hotels in the resort and is a very close walk to the park. Hong Kong Disneyland itself was very disappointing and much too small, but we did enjoy the hotel. The hotel is designed in a turn of the century, Victoria style design. The lobby is very elegant, with lots of seating and beautiful chandeliers. There is even a functional caged elevator that gives off a period feel. Large arched windows allowed lots of sunlight to fill this airy area. The pubic spaces in the hotel are very well themed and full of detail, a trademark of most Disney hotels. There were subtle Disney touches like Hidden Mickeys and other character motifs throughout the hotel. Our room was a fair size, with two double beds and a nice sitting area. Bathroom was quite nice, with a single sink and a small bathtub. Not too bad for the price we paid for the room (about $350). The balcony in the room was fairly small but we had a wonderful view of the South China Sea. Room itself was nothing too spectacular though. Beautiful, but pretty standard overall. Our major disappointment was with the restaurants. Food at the park was very poor and limited, but we expected better at the hotel. When we ordered room service, the food was only warm and rather tasteless. Dinner at their flagship restaurant Crystal Lotus was good but very overpriced. There are far better options in the city. The buffet at Enchanted Garden Restaurant was not particularly impressive, and the food was only so-so. The Disney characters were a very nice touch though, interacting with every table and such. Afternoon tea at the Grand Salon was very average. Definitely not in the same league as say, the Peninsula Hong Kong's but much cheaper. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay but were not amazed. The hotel is clearly meant to cater to families and as such, it would not be fair to compare it to a 5-star hotel or expect that level of luxury. That being said, I felt the dining options could be significantly improved upon. And the service, while friendly and generally welcoming, could be further polished.

Hollywood did not disappoint. Check-in was at 2pm and my first impression was the friendly and courteous bellhops. The lobby was very posh and clean. The receptionists spoke excellent English. The room was very clean and my kids were thrilled by the Mickey Mouse logos around the room. It was so easy getting to Disneyland, there is a big shuttle bus that leaves every 10 minutes from the hotel to Disneyland. Disneyland was amazing, for us adults and for our kids. It was very clean (never saw any China tourists spitting) and you see cleaners everywhere swooping down to sweep and remove rubbish from the streets. I was very impressed by the cleanliness and I thought it was far better than Gold Coast's Movieworld. I was told the best time to visit Disneyland was during weekdays, where you don't get much of a crowd, it was true. We never queued more than 5 minutes for any of the rides and the weather was absolutely perfect, nice and warm in the afternoons but once 5pm hits, the temperature takes a dive and it's cool till morning. We absolutely loved the fireworks at 8pm nightly, we were there for the 2nd night in a row and it was still enchanting to see the fireworks display. What slightly disappointed me about the hotel was that no complimentary mineral water was given and we either had to drink from the tap or buy the mineral water from the hotel's coffee-shop. We only had 2 meals at the hotel, lunch on the 1st day and bk'fast on the 2nd day. The portions were absolutely huge, so I suggest you share the meal rather than go to waste. I thought prices were reasonable, not too expensive. For 2 adults and 2 children, we spent about HKG200 for 2 big plates of spaghetti, 1 plate of rice with pork cutlet & 2 bottles of mineral water. The next morning we had the local bk'fast of dim sum which was so filling as the portions were large. My 2nd disappointment was with 'Breakfast with Mickey' that we had the next day. While we were checking in on the 1st day, we decided to take the bk'fast with Mickey, I thought it would be nice and that the kids would enjoy it. We got the the restaurant at 9am, it was a fancy chinese restaurant and the food was really very good, we had like 4 'courses' of bk'fast. I was told that Mickey and his friends would come out and mingle with the kids. Imaging our disappointment that only 2 characters came out for 1 minute just for photos, it was 'Mulan' whom my children were not familiar with and of course Mickey Mouse, but dressed in a Chinese outfit. They just came out for a minute, stood there while we took photos of them and the kids, then disappeared into the kitchen. Our disappointment was however appeased by the fantastic breakfast! If you're not carrying much luggage and if you intend to go to Kowloon or Hong Kong Island from Disneyland, it's so convenient to take the MTR, which is at the doorstep of Disneyland. It's fantastic, it's so convenient and such a pleasant ride. The hotel grounds are huge and they have a huge well manicured garden which my kids played in on our last day.

It is a very pleasant walk. If you've done Disney before you will find this the smallest park ever but what it lacks in attractions it makes up for in friendly atmosphere. The staff are wonderful (they found us most amusing for going on Space Mountain four times in a row!) and we had a lovely day - you can do the whole park in about 4 hours.

Disneymusic in the background in the elevator, in the hall, the staff with names like \"Cupid\", \"Angel\" and \"Princess\" and the decor of the hotel that makes you feel like a princess - or prince. Bus to the park from the front of the hotel. Not far from the airport either.

Staying in it was like every person's fairytale come true... everything was 'magical'... the little touches that the management have added certainly added to the 'magical' feel of the hotel. One 'minor' flaw in our otherwise perfect stay was the fire alarm that went off in the early morning of the 28th. As I was watching TV, my mum was doing her 'morning ritual'... fire alarms suddenly went off. Lucky, that we had the robes provided in the hotel to cover our state of undress as we hurriedly gathered our bags with all our valuables e.g. passports, wallet, camera etc. We stayed outside for approximately 45 minutes, without a clue as to what was happening, the thing that pissed me off was there was nobody from the management to officially explain what triggered the fire alarm. If there was fire in any part of the hotel or, if it was already safe enough to return. We had to follow the trickle of guests who decided to go back in.

He was so excited when the taxi drove into the hotel's driveway. He wanted to ask the bellhop if Mickey stays there. The hotel has all the typical Disney touches - bronze statues of Mickey and Minnie at the entrance of the main entrance. Because it was Christmas season, there was a huge Christmas tree and other festive decorations. Checking-in was stress free. There is a specially created corner near the check-in counter for children to watch Disney cartoons while we complete the necessarily procedure. We reserved the Garden View room. Although it was the same level as the lobby, the room was far from the maddening crowd. It was really huge by HK standards. The two single twin beds were sufficient for the three of us. There is even a specially made stool for my son to stand on to wash his hands by the sink. If the child needs a break from Disneyland, there are Disney channels, movies and activities organised by the hotel to keep him occupied. Disneyland Hotel provides a free shuttle to Disneyland at 10 minute interval. We found visiting the park very convenient because of this service. No visit to Disneyland Hotel is complete without buffet breakfast in the Enchanted Garden. Apart from the buffet section for children, the Disney characters coming for breakfast certainly make the day of any child or adult!

There was a step stool in the bathroom, complimentary water and milk in the fridge, and a very nice amenity kit. The bed was very, very comfortable and the room-darkening curtains were exactly that. They were perfect. No light came through at all - very nice if you have children who need to nap in the middle of the day. The grounds were immaculate and so gorgeous.

We joined the Tung chung MTR line at Hong Kong Central (this also picks up in Kowloon 3 minutes later) and continued onto Sunny Bay Station where we changed train and joined the disneyline. How fab was it when the Disney train arrived every window on the train was the shape of Mickey Mouses head. Even once on board the hand rails were Mickey Mouse shaped too. from that moment we knew we were in for a terrific time. Within 30 mins of leaving Hong Kong Island we had arrived at Disney. Jumped on the free shuttle bus to the Disneyland Hotel. We stopped enroute to drop off passengers at the Hollywood Hotel but when we arrived at our Hotel we knew we had made the right choice. My Husband ,son (age 2) and myself had booked a Kingdom Club Room which we had a full sea view on the 7th floor and access to the lounge which served nibbles,breakfasts etc. The hotel rooms were truly wonderful worth every penny. On the first night we watched the fireworks from the balcony in the club lounge this was excellent.Powerful showers spotless everywhere flat screen tv even a small one in the bath room free mini bar. The first morning we had breakfast in the club lounge, but the second morning we had a character breakfast in the enchanted restaurant this is well worth doing and again worth every penny the choice of food was unreal. from english breakfast to chinese breakfast fresh fruit. Good choice for children. I only had one little grumble and that was the room service choice of the childrens menu of which i did mention to the staff on check out. We stayed at this hotel after Easter which turned out to be agood choice as it was very quiet. The service of the staff was superb and nothing was to much trouble. It was very sad to leave this truly luxurious hotel. Never mind we still have the memory.
